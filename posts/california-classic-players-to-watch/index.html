<p>With the NBA Draft and most of free agency behind us it’s time to pivot to the next major event of the NBA offseason, the Summer League. After a short period devoid of basketball fans of all teams can get excited to cheer on some of the faces of their futures. As time has gone on Summer League has become a massive event to showcase the new rookie class making their NBA debuts, but we cannot forget some of the second year players looking to wow everyone with their improvements over the offseason.</p>
<p>Every year we see a few second year players come to Summer League and look like men amongst boys with the way they dominate. While success in Summer League does not equate to success in the NBA it does give us some fun things to look at during the long haul to the start of the regular season. Getting the summer started in California we have the Lakers, Kings, Heat, Warriors, Hornets, and Spurs. While these games are not always the highest quality they give us a glimpse at some fun players who will have roles come the start of the NBA season.</p>
<p><strong>Brandin Podziemski and Trayce Jackson-Davis</strong></p>
<p>The Golden State Warriors did not make a single pick in the 2024 NBA Draft but they do have two very interesting second year players that I will be keeping a close eye on. Those players are combo guard Brandin Podziemski and big man Trayce Jackson-Davis. While Jackson-Davis did not play a massive role in his rookie year Podziemski was able to earn All-Rookie First Team honors next to some big names like Victor Wembanyama and Chet Holmgren. Although Podziemski will likely never reach the heights of those two he looks to be a very valuable player for a long time with a versatile skill set.</p>
<p>In year one with the Warriors Podziemski was able to carve out a solid bench role for himself playing 26 minutes a night and had averages of 9.2 points, 5.8 boards, and 3.7 assists per game. While many won’t be impressed by these numbers they are good for a rookie and even better when put in context with his efficiency and low turnover numbers. One thing that the numbers cannot put into context is his hustle and all around impact on the court.</p>
<p>My favorite part of Podziemski’s game is the effort and energy he plays with. He is willing to do whatever the Warriors ask of him whether that be diving on loose balls or putting his body on the line taking charges. Podziemski also showed his hustle by being a great rebounder for his position. He is not a great athlete, but he uses his high IQ, change of pace, and craft to get to his spots to score and find teammates. Pair this with is ability to space the floor and you have one of the more versatile young players in the NBA.</p>
<p>At the California Classic and throughout all of Summer League I want to see the Warriors put the ball in his hands more and see what he can do with it. When he played at Santa Clara and in flashes with the Warriors this year he had some really crafty drives and finishes as well as some fun shot creation in the mid-range and from three. This summer could provide the perfect opportunity for him to grow into more than just a versatile role player as the starting guard position next to Steph Curry opened up with the departure of Klay Thompson.</p>
<p>Trayce Jackson-Davis did not have the same production or role as Podziemski, but he did make some jaw dropping plays for the Warriors this season including a poster dunk on rookie sensation Victor Wembanyama. In only 16 minutes per game Jackson-Davis was able to average 7.9 points, 5 rebounds, 1.2 assists, and 1.1 blocks. Similar to Podziemski the numbers do not jump off the page, but with context they look a lot better. Jackson-Davis ended the season shooting 70% from the field which is not super surprising because almost all of his shots are layups and dunks.</p>
<p>Not only was Jackson-Davis a great finisher at the rim, but he showed great things as a screener and roller. In this Warriors offense he was able to use the offensive gravity players like Steph Curry and Klay Thompson have to get easy looks as a roll man. His screening is also valuable in an offense that is centered around off-ball movement to get shooters open. The most intriguing part of his game was the flashes in the short roll. Jackson-Davis was able to use his footwork and post-game that he developed in college to finish around the rim after catching in the short roll.</p>
<p>This summer I hope to see the Warriors lean into his skills as a screener and roller with the high IQ and skill of Podziemski to create a deadly two-man game that most summer league teams would be unable to stop. Since Jackson-Davis is mostly a play finisher at this point having a guard like Podziemski who can quickly hit him in roll situations will be key for his success. While I have my doubts about playing two non shooters together like Jackson-Davis and Draymond Green I cannot deny that he is a higher potential option compared to incumbent starter Kevon Looney.</p>
<p><strong>Dalton Knecht</strong></p>
<p>After a slide out of the lottery on draft night Dalton Knecht ended up on the Los Angeles Lakers, much to my chagrin. Knecht was one of my favorite players throughout the draft cycle with his 3-level scoring ability, shooting versatility, and above average athleticism. At Tennessee Knecht was an absolute flamethrower, scoring from anywhere on the court. He was most successful when used as an off-ball movement shooter and getting downhill on off-ball actions. This is where he expects him to instantly translate to the NBA playing off stars like Lebron James and Anthony Davis.</p>
<p>Even though I expect Knecht to play mostly as an off-ball player for the Lakers this season, that probably will not be the case during Summer League. The roster for the Lakers Summer League team does not have anyone that I would consider a good enough shot creator to take the ball out of Knecht’s hands. He showed the ability at Tennessee to carry an offense almost single handedly and I would not be surprised if he has to do so again this summer. Knecht’s success this summer will likely be based on whether or not his pull up shot is falling, which was somewhat inconsistent at Tennessee. With improved spacing of the NBA I expect him to get easier looks then the ones he had to settle for in college.</p>
<p><strong>Stephon Castle</strong></p>
<p>With the 4th pick in this year’s draft the Spurs took the lockdown defensive wing/guard Stephon Castle out of UConn. Castle was a fairly divisive prospect with some not buying his offensive game. I was one who was completely bought in on Castle despite some of the shooting concerns he showed in college. His combination of tenacious defense and high IQ playmaking fits what the Spurs have looked for in prospects over the last few years.</p>
<p>My intrigue with Castle is centered around what role he will be playing during Summer League. Castle made it known that he wants a chance to play point guard for whichever team drafted him and the Spurs have an opening at the spot in the long-term. I expect that they allow Castle to play point as he is one of the few members of their Summer League team that they view as a long-term piece of their team.</p>
<p>I do have some worries about how Castle will step into this role because of his shooting inconsistencies. His offensive game is based on his NBA ready frame and strength to power through defenders and use his footwork to find crafty finishing angles. I worry that the inconsistent jumper could cause teams to sag off and make him force things as a driver. Even if teams collapse hard on his drives, Castle’s quick decision making should let him find open teammates if they are in proper positions.</p>
<p><strong>Nick Smith Jr</strong></p>
<p>Going into his one and only college season at Arkansas, Nick Smith Jr was a potential top 5 pick. He provided a combo of off-ball shooting, shot creation, in a 6’5 frame that had many NBA teams intrigued. After a disappointing freshman year he ended up dropping to the end of the first round where the Hornets scooped in the young guard. Now entering his second year Smith Jr has the opportunity to showcase if he made the improvements needed to get a consistent role for the upcoming season.</p>
<p>For Charlotte this year Smith Jr appeared in 51 games, but had a small role only playing 14 minutes a night. One of my main concerns with him as a prospect was his slim frame and how that would affect his ability to score inside and pressure the rim. Those concerns turned out to be just as he shot a measly 35% from two. Even though he was bad from two, Smith Jr shot 43% from three on 146 total attempts. This perimeter shooting skill gives him a valuable skill that could get him on the court more often next year.</p>
<p>At the California Classic I hope to see an improved interior game from Smith Jr.&nbsp;One year in the NBA should have let him put on some much needed strength to handle the physicality of NBA players. I do not expect a massive jump, but if he put on enough strength to get to his spots as a pull up shooter better it could lead to improved efficiency from two. He will likely need another year to put on more strength to become any type of threat in the paint and he will likely never become a consistent rim pressure player, but adding some type of threat from inside will increase his scoring upside.</p>
