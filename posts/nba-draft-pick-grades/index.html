<p><strong>No.1 Atlanta Hawks: Zaccharie Risacher Grade: C-</strong></p>
<p>With the No.1 pick the Atlanta Hawks select french wing Zaccharie Risacher. Risacher has tantalizing 3-and-D skills that would fit next to an established star like Trae Young. My main issue with this pick is the limited upside I believe Risacher has because of his lack of ball handling skills, passing feel, and other better players on the board. Adding either Alex Sarr or Donovan Clingan would’ve given the Hawks a defensive anchor that can complement Trae Young in the pick-and-roll game.</p>
<p><strong>No.2 Washington Wizards: Alex Sarr Grade: A+</strong></p>
<p>At No.2 the Wizards get the top player off my big board in Alex Sarr. Sarr’s rare mix of size, athleticism, and mobility give the Wizards a player who can hopefully anchor their defense with rim protection and versatility. Washington is a long ways away from competing which gives a raw prospect like Sarr the chance to experiment and grow his offensive game. The starting center for the Wizards is currently Marvin Bagley so I expect Sarr to get lots of opportunity right away and hopefully form a formidable French duo with Bilal Coulibaly.</p>
<p><strong>No.3 Houston Rockets: Reed Sheppard Grade: A+</strong></p>
<p>Houston’s young core is already packed with wings and forwards like Cam Whitmore, Jabari Smith, and Amen Thompson. Adding Sheppard gives them a young guard who can perfectly complement them with elite shooting and secondary playmaking. Fred VanVleet fits a similar mold to Sheppard which should help with his adjustment to the NBA. With VanVleet having two years left on his deal and being older than the rest of the Rockets core we could see Sheppard step into that role once they have moved on.</p>
<p><strong>No.4 San Antonio Spurs: Stephon Castle Grade: A+</strong></p>
<p>The Spurs make their defense even better by adding Stephon Castle to their team. Outside of Victor Wembanyama and Devin Vassell there is not much set in stone on the Spurs roster long term. This can allow for experimentation with Castle as a point guard which he showed some capability of playing at UConn. If that doesn’t work Castle can settle in as a defensive and connector wing while developing his shooting. It’s hard for someone not to fit next to Wembanyama but Castle’s quick decision making should create plenty of open looks for the generational talent.</p>
<p><strong>No.5 Detroit Pistons: Ron Holland Grade: A</strong></p>
<p>After many rumors of him sliding on draft night Ron Holland ends up going inside the top 5. While playing with the Ignite Holland had an up and down season, but I believe that had more to do with the situation than Holland as a player. He was placed into an on-ball role that did not suit his play style. Next to Cade Cunningham, Holland can focus on defense where he can make a major impact with his athleticism. The Pistons still desperately need shooting which Holland does not provide, but I cannot fault them for taking a top 5 player on my board hence the grade.</p>
<p><strong>No.6 Charlotte Hornets: Tidjane Salaun Grade: D</strong></p>
<p>I personally do not see it with Salaun. He is being given this title of a giant shooting forward, but there is a long way to go to realize this. His size and shooting potential is his main selling point, but there is a long way to go before that consistency is recognized. I also feel he lacks basketball IQ and feel to become much more than a spot up shooter. Charlotte is in desperate need of good basketball players to play next to rising stars Lamelo Ball and Brandon Miller. Salaun doesn’t project to be one of those for multiple years.</p>
<p><strong>No.7 Portland Trail Blazers: Donovan Clingan Grade: A+</strong></p>
<p>Clingan is the final player in the top tier of my draft board. This UConn center is a mountain of a human that I believe will be a defensive anchor for many years to come. While his defense is the main selling point, Clingan showed lots of potential as a pick-and-roll finisher and passer. NBA teams have made some noise about him possibly stepping out to range even though he did not shoot it in college. I tend to believe he won’t shoot it, at least not early in his career. Portland now has the perfect big man that can complement a smaller guard like Scoot Henderson as a screener, roller, and defensively.</p>
<p><strong>No.8 Minnesota Timberwolves: Rob Dillingham Grade: A</strong></p>
<p>The Timberwolves make the first big splash of the night by trading up for Rob Dillingham. With Mike Conley only getting older, adding a young guard with tons of potential like Dillingham is a great move. Dillingham’s shooting and shot creation should be perfect as a secondary option next to Anthony Edwards. His defensive deficiencies can also be hidden behind the elite rim protection of Rudy Gobert. I worry some about Dillingham’s size and weight, especially on the defensive end, but Minnesota provides a perfect situation to make up for that.</p>
<p><strong>No.9 Memphis Grizzlies: Zach Edey Grade: C</strong></p>
<p>One of the best players in the history of college basketball gets taken in the top 10. A lot has been made about whether Edey’s game will translate to the NBA. In some ways it will, but in other ways it won’t. In Memphis Edey can focus on the things he is elite at like screen setting and rolling to the rim. Memphis desperately missed Steven Adams so I do not mind the fit, I just tend to prioritize versatility and Edey does not provide much of that.</p>
<p><strong>No.10 Utah Jazz: Cody Williams Grade: B+</strong></p>
<p>Utah takes one of my favorite project players in Cody Williams. Being the brother of OKC Thunder’s Jalen Williams helps, but Cody still brings plenty of his own to the table. His best skill is his finishing around the rim which the Jazz desperately need. Lauri Markkanen and Keyonte George are predominantly perimeter scorers so Cody’s rim pressure provides some offensive versatility. Along with his finishing Cody has the length and athleticism to be a great defender like his brother. As his frame fills out and he improves his handle, Williams could return immense value to Utah.</p>
<p><strong>No.11 Chicago Bulls: Matas Buzelis Grade: B</strong></p>
<p>After trading Alex Caruso to the Thunder for Josh Giddey it seems the Bulls are entering a rebuild. They make this seem even more certain by taking a swing at the highly athletic Matas Buzelis. Buzelis suffered from some of the same issues Ron Holland faced playing with the disorganized G League Ignite, but he also flashed less than Holland. I really worry about his offense since he lacks a go to scoring method and has questions about his jumper. I like what he provides on the defensive end and think there is room to grow because of his physical tools. Luckily this rebuild should give Buzelis the time to develop his skills as they accumulate more young talent.</p>
<p><strong>No.12 Oklahoma City Thunder: Nikola Topic Grade: C-</strong></p>
<p>While I have Topic as a top 10 player on my board there were players that I had higher and that fit the current Thunder roster better like Dalton Knecht, Devin Carter, and Tristan da Silva. Topic’s skill set is similar to the player that the Thunder just traded away because of fit so I’m confused on why they would go down that road again. Topic is the best passer in this class, but on a team that already has SGA and Jalen Williams I wonder how he gets the on ball reps to showcase this. I hope that Topic proves me wrong, especially since I’m a Thunder fan, but witnessing how much a non shooter can mess up an offense come playoff time I question the selection.</p>
<p><strong>No.13 Sacramento Kings: Devin Carter Grade: A+</strong></p>
<p>Adding Devin Carter gives the Kings what they wished they got out of Davion Mitchell. Carter is a DAWG by every definition. He hounds dudes on defense using his elite athleticism and strong chest to keep them in front of him. He had a massive offensive breakout this year with Providence where his shooting took a major leap. Some question this but the difficulty, range, and confidence in his shot make me believe it’s legit. After a disappointing year where they missed the playoffs the Kings add a player that can come in and play a big role for them day one.</p>
<p><strong>No.14 Washington Wizards: Bub Carrington Grade: B</strong></p>
<p>Washington landed their big man of the future with Alex Sarr at no.2 and now look for a guard to pair with him at no.14 with Bub Carrington. Carrington was a crafty pull up shooter that showed great prowess in the pick-and-roll at Pitt. He was somewhat inconsistent at the rim and on the defensive end, but he flashed some things that make me hopeful he can develop those skills. Washington gives him the perfect environment to discover the type of player he is and to improve upon his weaknesses since they lack a long-term initiator.</p>
<p><strong>No.15 Miami Heat: Kel’el Ware Grade: C+</strong></p>
<p>Ware is a high upside big that looks fit what teams look for in a modern day big man. He has the desired size and athleticism giving him great potential as a rim protector and vertical spacer. He also flashed perimeter shooting connecting on over 40% of his 3’s. While there is great potential in Ware there are questions around whether he can reach it. He was not the hardest worker on the court, something I want out of big men if they are going to be my team’s rim protector. Miami’s development staff is one of the best in the NBA so if anyone can get Ware to reach his potential it’s them.</p>
<p><strong>No.16 Philadelphia 76ers: Jared McCain Grade: A-</strong></p>
<p>Entering this off season the 76ers have three players on their roster, Joel Embiid, Tyrese Maxey, and Paul Reed. Adding Jared McCain gives them a great shooter that can play next to their stars. Some were weary of him because of his small size and wingspan, but he plays a lot bigger than that. He is a good rebounder for his size and plays a physical, tough style of defense. Next to Tyrese Maxey, McCain can maximize his off-ball skills and hopefully grow into more.</p>
<p><strong>No.17 Los Angeles Lakers: Dalton Knecht Grade: A+</strong></p>
<p>The Lakers were looking for players that can play now and that complement their stars. Knecht fits this definition to a tee. I had Knecht as a top 7 player in this class and the Lakers got him at 17. Adding Knecht gives the Lakers a flamethrower from all levels of the court. Few in this class can match his scoring output when on fire or the variety of shots he can take/make. If teams run him off the line he has the handle and athleticism to rise up and throw down on big men. I expect Knecht to make a major impact from day 1 with his shooting gravity and scoring skills which is going to make a lot of NBA teams look stupid.</p>
<p><strong>No.18 Orlando Magic: Tristan da Silva Grade: A+</strong></p>
<p>Similar to the Lakers a pick before, the Magic land one of my favorite players in the class who dropped because of their age in Tristan da Silva. At Colorado da Silva was a versatile wing that could fill any role at the snap of a finger. He fits the dribble-pass-shoot definition and gives the Magic another tall, skilled offensive player. His versatility will be key in playing a role next to rising stars Paolo Banchero and Franz Wagner. As Orlando continues to build toward contending I can see da Silva playing a big role in that future success.</p>
<p><strong>No.19 Toronto Raptors: Ja’kobe Walter Grade: B-</strong></p>
<p>After giving Scottie Barnes a max extension and committing to build around him it will be a priority to surround him with good shooters. Ja’kobe Walter cna provide just that in a plethora of ways. Walter is somewhat similar to Dalton Knecht in terms of shooting versatility, but he lacks the consistency Knecht had. In the NBA he should receive less defensive attention than he did at Baylor hopefully resulting in better shooting numbers. Outside of his shooting I struggle to find an area he can consistently make an impact which makes me worry about his impact. If his shooting is consistent from the jump in the NBA he can carve out a role for himself, but if it isn’t it will be hard for Toronto to give him minutes regularly.</p>
<p><strong>No.20 Cleveland Cavaliers: Jaylon Tyson Grade: A</strong></p>
<p>Cleveland has struggled to get production out of their wings for a while now and look to change that by selecting Jaylon Tyson. Tyson brings a lot of offensive versatility and good ball handling skills for a 6’7 wing. There are some questions about his shot selection and decision making, but decreased usage should help with that. If he makes these changes Tyson can become a versatile piece next to the Cavs core four of Mitchell, Garland, Mobley, and Allen.</p>
<p><strong>No.21 New Orleans Pelicans: Yves Missi Grade: B</strong></p>
<p>New Orleans has made it clear they want to make major roster adjustments focusing on building around Zion Williamson. Jonas Valanciunas has been viewed as one of the casualties of these changes. Drafting Yves Missi gives the Pelicans the complete opposite archetype of center. Missi profiles as an athletic rim runner and rim protector that can clean up mistakes made by his teammates. He is still young and needs to make some technical improvements but has a great base to start with.</p>
<p><strong>No.22 Denver Nuggets: DaRon Holmes Grade: A-</strong></p>
<p>Denver has gotten killed in the non-Jokic minutes the last few seasons due to them lacking a legitimate NBA caliber back up big. They look to change this by adding Dayton big man DaRon Holmes. At Dayton, Holmes was a do it all big man who shouldered a lot of the scoring, playmaking, and defensive load. He was highly productive and made improvements over every season. His strides in the playmaking and shooting department as well as flashes off the bounce make him an intriguing player who might still have some untapped upside despite being a multi year college player.</p>
<p><strong>No.23 Milwuakee Bucks: AJ Johnson Grade: C</strong></p>
<p>AJ Johnson is a massive swing taken by the Bucks. After decommitting from Texas and going overseas to the NBL where he had an up and down season to put it nicely. He played a low amount of minutes which led to poor numbers, despite that he still flashed some interesting tools. A lot of Johnson’s evaluation is built on projecting his athleticism and work ethic to pay off. He could’ve easily coasted because of the inconsistent minutes but instead played hard and showed willingness to play multiple roles. There is a long way to go from a skills standpoint and would’ve rather seen a contending team like Milwaukee draft a player to help their current core.</p>
<p><strong>No.24 Washington Wizards: Kyshawn George Grade: B-</strong></p>
<p>With their third pick in the first round the Wizards take highly skilled wing Kyshawn George. At Miami George showcased great shooting and guard skills at a tall, lengthy 6’8. Those skills at that size make a lot of NBA teams salivate. My main question surrounding George is his athleticism. As a driver he doesn’t have a quick first step or a second gear to speed past defenders. His game is built on his finesse skills like ball handling and shooting which can be harder to succeed with against NBA competition.</p>
<p><strong>No.25 New York Knicks: Pacome Dadiet Grade: B</strong></p>
<p>The Knicks made waves earlier trading a haul for Nets Mikal Bridges. Their roster for the 2024-25 season is mostly set already so they have the opportunity to swing for the fences with a young, high upside player. Pacome Dadiet gives them a ball of clay that they can mold however they want. His all around offensive skill makes him such a intriguing upside swing that I have higher on my board than 6th pick Tidjane Salaun.</p>
<p><strong>No.26 Oklahoma City Thunder: Dillon Jones Grade: B</strong></p>
<p>After a questionable pick at no.12 the Thunder trade back up and select Dillon Jones. Jones is a stocky, bruising wing that did everything for his Weber State team. He he tremendous box score numbers and was the only player on college basketball this year to register above 30% assists rate, 30% rebound rate, and above 3% steal rate. This all around play style should let him fill multiple roles the Thunder ask of him. One worry is that he played predominantly with the ball in his hands which will not be the case in OKC. I expect him to transition into an off ball role somewhat smoothly thanks to his natural IQ and feel.</p>
<p><strong>No.27 Minnesota Timberwolves: Terrence Shannon Grade: C+</strong></p>
<p>After trading for Rob Dillingham is expected the Timberwolves to trade out of this pick but instead they take 5th year senior Terrence Shannon. Shannon put up great numbers at Illinois, but the film didn’t completely match them. I thought he was over reliant on his athleticism and struggled to play at different speeds when attacking the rim. To be successful in the NBA he will have to buy into the defensive side of the ball because his scoring isn’t good enough to warrant being a top option.</p>
<p><strong>No.28 Phoenix Suns: Ryan Dunn Grade: B</strong></p>
<p>Dunn’s game is incredibly simple, he’s going to lock down anyone you put in front of him, but lacks any sort of use on offense. Dunn is easily the best defender in the class, something the Suns stars will welcome with open arms. His lack of a role on the offensive end could cause some problems, especially come playoff time.</p>
<p><strong>No.29 Utah Jazz: Isaiah Collier Grade: A+</strong></p>
<p>I’m not the highest on Collier, but I would not have let him fall this far. In terms of upside Collier is unmatched. He is a walking paint touch with some solid playmaking instincts that some believe make him one of the best players in the class. He showed the ability to create advantages with this quick first step, but was inconsistent in turning those advantages into positives for his team. If Utah can develop Collier they will reap massive rewards as he would complement Lauri Markkanen perfectly with his rim pressure and playmaking.</p>
<p><strong>No.30 Boston Celtics: Baylor Scheierman Grade: A+</strong></p>
<p>I was a lot higher on Scheieman than this selection, having him inside my top 20. During his 5th year at Creighton he was the epitome of dribble-pass-shoot. He was a deadly shooter connecting on 38% of his 3’s and ranked in the 99th percentile as a pick-and-roll ball handler per Synergy. He definitely has some athletic deficiencies, but his skill as a player makes up for this. The NBA continues to be obsessed with players’ age instead of if they are actually good basketball players which lets smart teams like Boston continue to add talented players to their championship core.</p>
