<p>In the ever-evolving landscape of basketball teams have become obsessed with positional size. The days of smaller guards dissecting defenses seem to be coming to a close. Sure players like Trae Young and Jalen Brunson still exist, but teams see the difficulties that building a contender around a physically limited player can bring.</p>
<p>We have seen this trend have a major impact on how some NBA teams draft. Teams are beginning to let smaller guards fall in the draft in favor of taller, longer players, for better or worse. We saw this happen with the massive fall of Tyrese Maxey in 2020, and more recently with Brandon Miller leaping Scoot Henderson in 2023. While the Miller-Henderson situation doesn’t really matter as both look to have bright futures and were only one pick apart, but the Maxey situation was eye-opening.</p>
<p>In recent years the mixed results of drafting small guards is a key contributor to the archetype becoming less valued. Most of the time these players are either turning into all-star lead playmakers like Ja Morant and Tyrese Maxey or out of the league before they can jump-start their careers like Kennedy Chandler and Nico Mannion. In 2024, two electrifying guards from Kentucky are looking to change the narrative surrounding the small guard archetype.</p>
<p>Reed Sheppard and Rob Dillingham took the college basketball world by storm. Both were among the most impactful freshman in 2024 leading Kentucky to a 3 seed in the NCAA Tournament even though they predominantly came off the bench. Their performances in March Madness left much to be desired, but their full body of work immensely outweighed that. Both guard have different styles of play, but their overall consistency has cemented then near the top of mine and many others big boards.</p>
<p>Reed Sheppard</p>
<p>Coming into the draft cycle I was unsure of what Reed Sheppard was going to look like at Kentucky. Even though he was a McDonald’s All-American I found myself having some doubts mainly pertaining to his size and athleticism. Reed silenced all of those concerns with a phenomenal season where he did so many things for Kentucky.</p>
<p>When talking about Reed Sheppard you cannot start with anything but his shooting. On the season Sheppard scorched the nets shooting over 50% from three on 144 total attempts. Over the course of the season, many were expecting his efficiency to trail off at some point but it never did. Sheppard didn’t display typical movement shooting off of screens, but he did show the ability to consistently relocate to open areas making kickouts for open 3’s easier to get. This was one of the many ways Sheppard showcased his basketball IQ and natural feel for the game.</p>
<p>Sheppard was not just a spot-up shooter as he was able to pull up from mid-range and three. His mechanics are silky smooth and easily repeatable so I fully expect the elite shooting to translate right away. For Reed to fully realize his potential as a shooter he will have to improve his shot creation. Sheppard already has some moves in his bag like his go-to left to right cross into a pull-up jumper, but he is not always able to get to his spots as a scorer. With a little more creativity as a ball handler, he could take his shooting to an even higher level.</p>
<p>The other aspect of Sheppard’s offensive game is his finishing. While he only had 60 shots at the rim he ended up finishing 65% of them. His height and wingspan might give him some issues at the NBA level, but the biggest one is his first step. Sheppard is not incredibly bursty as a ball handler and that could cause him problems trying to pressure the rim, hence the lack of rim attempts. To make up for this Sheppard shows some nice craft and pushes his 42-inch vertical to its limit. I do not expect him to be a high rim pressure player, but if he can get teams to sell out on his perimeter shooting he could find himself getting some easy rim attempts.</p>
<p>Sheppard also made his impact felt as a playmaker. Earlier I mentioned how Reed is one of the higher IQ and feel players in this class and his passing perfectly encompasses this. Looking at the raw numbers Sheppard had 148 assists to 66 turnovers, good enough for a 2.2 assist-to-turnover ratio. Like with his scoring, Sheppard plays with a smart style as a passer, prioritizing making the right decisions without putting the ball in harm’s way.</p>
<p>Sheppard combines his natural IQ and feel with incredible court vision and quick decision making which allows him to find teammates from any spot on the floor. These skills also make it easy for him to identify help defenders and then find the open player whether it’s a kick out for 3 or a dump off to a cutter or dunker spot sitter. Right now Sheppard is better suited as a connective playmaking combo guard next to a primary initiator, but he had some really fun flashes that make me believe he could handle more playmaking responsibility in the future.</p>
<p>As a ball handler, Sheppard showed great promise as a live dribble playmaker and pick-and-roll initiator. He threw a couple of gnarly skip passes and had some crazy kickouts from deep in the paint that left me stunned. He had a great command a pick-and-roll ball handler and passer. Sheppard did not let defenders speed up his process and dissected many PNR coverages with ease. If Sheppard can continue to grow upon these flashes he could return immense value as a primary playmaker.</p>
<p>The area I did not expect Sheppard to make as big of an impact as he did was on defense. The stigma that surrounds small guards is that they will be a negative on defense. Sheppard was far from that, becoming one of the more pesky off-ball defenders in this draft. Sheppard had 82 steals on the season which led the SEC and put him second all-time to Rajon Rondo for steals in a season for a Kentucky player. He paired lightning-fast hands with great timing and anticipation to be a lethal weapon jumping passing lanes and stripping drivers.</p>
<p>Along with the deflections and steals Sheppard showed a great understanding of rotations and responsibilities off the ball. He was disruptive digging down on drivers and post-ups leading to lots of turnovers. Proper positioning and his 42-inch vertical also let him rack up more blocks than you would expect from a 6’3 guard. Some of this impact might decline since NBA athletes are on a whole different level compared to college, but expecting all of Sheppard’s impact to be negated is foolish.</p>
<p>Compared to Sheppard’s off-ball defense his on-ball defense was less moving. He was in no way a bad on-ball defender just not a great one either. I have some questions about his ability to keep up laterally with the most athletically gifted guards. His size profile of 6’3 with a 6’3 wingspan also doesn’t give him much help. These factors could lead teams to match up hunting Sheppard, especially in must-win scenarios. Even if he was an above-average on-ball defender teams would probably still try to match-up hunt him just because of the poor physical tools.</p>
<p>Rob Dillingham</p>
<p>Similar to Sheppard, Rob Dillingham was another player that many evaluators, including myself, were skeptical about. Many had seen the flashes of brilliant shot creation and making Dillingham showed in high school and at Overtime Elite before committing to Kentucky. In some of the clips he consistently was off balance or not set, but still knocked down jumpers which left me in awe. Even with those highlights, I doubted how realistic and translatable that would be in the college setting. Luckily Rob learned to contain the craziness, but let it out when needed.</p>
<p>The skill that sets Dillingham apart from others in this class is his shot creation. Nobody in this class has a more creative off-dribble scoring game than Dillingham. His speed and shiftiness as a ball handler make it hard for defenders to stay in front of him. If they try to give him more space to counter the speed Dillingham just stops on a dime and pulls up from mid-range or 3. He shot 43% on non-rim 2’s and was only assisted on 22% of them makes me even more confident in his off-dribble shooting.</p>
<p>The area Dillingham made the biggest strides was reigning himself in and making an impact without the ball in his hands. Before playing at Kentucky most were low on Dillingham’s impact as an off-ball player. At Kentucky, he full leaned into this type of role since there were multiple other creators on the roster. His perimeter shooting was never a question but things like off-ball engagement were. He silenced those concerns by doing similar things to Reed Sheppard like relocating off teammate’s drives.</p>
<p>Being able to play off the ball is important for players like Dillingham because it is becoming more and more common for teams to use multiple offensive initiators instead of one high-usage player. We have seen the success teams like the Celtics and Meverick had this year behind similar team constructs. Dillingham’s mixture of on-ball creation upside, off-ball shooting, and the ability to catch fire at any time makes him one of the most deadly and versatile perimeter players in the class.</p>
<p>The aspect of Dillingham’s scoring that has some questions surrounding it is his finishing. I believe that Dillingham is going to struggle scoring around the rim at first because it is common for small guards. His height and weight are big red flags in projecting him to be a good finisher. He does have some things going for him, those being his creativity and touch. As Dillingham matures and possibly puts on more weight with time we could see his finishing consistency increase.</p>
<p>The part of Dillingham’s game that I think grew the most was his passing and playmaking. Rob is at his best as a playmaker when thinking about scoring first. Defenses know that he is a huge threat as a jump shooter both off the catch and dribble. This makes defenders unconsciously gravitate toward him to take away his scoring. This over-commitment let Dillingham put his vision and playmaking on full display.</p>
<p>When attacking he always has his eyes up reading and reacting to what help defenders do. If the help collapses he can easily find spot-up shooters, bigs, and cutters. His mastery of the mid-range makes opposing bigs have to step up opening pocket passes and lobs to roll men. While I do not think his IQ and feel are as high as his backcourt mate, his more advanced and creative handle lets him get to his spots as a scorer and passer more consistently than Sheppard.</p>
<p>The aspect of Dillingham’s game that is the biggest reason some are nonbelievers is his play on the defensive end. Whether it be poor production, poor technique, or poor physical tools it is hard to project Dillingham’s defensive future. If Dillingham becomes a centerpiece of a championship-caliber team, they will need to heavily consider the players that surround him in order to negate his defensive deficiencies.</p>
<p>Looking at Dillingham’s raw defensive numbers we see that he only had 33 steals and 2 blocks which isn’t super surprising for a player of his size. His defensive technique is also unrefined at this point. He doesn’t get low enough in his defensive stance and tends to hop with ball handlers instead of sliding his feet. Even if Dillingham can stay in front of players his small stature and slim frame make it easy for offensive players to overpower him or shoot over him. There were also times I felt that Dillingham wasn’t giving the greatest effort on defense. This mostly showed up in his screen navigation where he found himself screened out of the play pretty often.</p>
<p>I have a hard time believing that Dillingham can’t improve on the defensive end since there are so many areas that need work. I also thought he showed a solid understanding as a team defender and has flashes of quick hands. If he continues to build upon those he could provide an impact as an off-ball pest disrupting the flow of offenses. While I am still pessimistic about Dillingham’s defensive outlook, you aren’t drafting him for his defense. Every prospect in this draft has some sort of weakness, but few possess a great to elite skill. Dillingham’s shooting versatility, shot creation creativity, and playmaking confidence give him one of the highest offensive ceilings in this class.</p>
