    "text": "2023 was an interesting year for NFL offenses and QBs. After years of consistent improvement in QB play this year was different. This down year at the QB position contributed to one of the weirdest MVP races in recent memory.\nBaltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson ended up winning the 2023 NFL MVP award in a landslide securing 49 of the 50 first-place votes. Jackson was critical to the Ravens’ success this year leading them to a 13-3 record, the best in the NFL, but he lacked some of the other criteria that past MVP had.\nWhile you cannot question Jackson’s impact on the Ravens you can question if he was the “most valuable” player in the NFL. Multiple other QBs put up similar or superior individual stats but fell short in the team success category.\nSo, how do you evaluate which player brings more value than another? That’s the hard part.\nA starting point is evaluating which plays are more valuable than others. Since the revolution of the passing game, passing plays have become more efficient and effective than rushing plays.\nThis can be displayed by the average expected points added per play(EPA/play) for passing and rushing plays. On the season only three teams had a positive EPA/play on rushing plays, the 49ers, Ravens, and Bills. This means on average only the 49ers, Ravens, and Bills increase their odds of scoring when they run the ball.\nNow that we know what play type brings more value we can dive into the numbers and we’ll see which MVP candidates brought the most value.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggtext)\n\nqb_raw_stats &lt;- read_csv(\"qbrawstats.csv\") |&gt;\n  mutate(Player=gsub(\"\\\\*\",\"\",Player)) |&gt;\n  mutate(Player=gsub(\"\\\\+\",\"\",Player))\n\nmvps &lt;- c(\"Dak Prescott\", \"Lamar Jackson\", \"Josh Allen\", \"Brock Purdy\")\n\nmvp &lt;- qb_raw_stats |&gt;

Dak Prescott dominated basic throwing stats. Not only did he lead in total passing volume(completions and attempts) but he posted some of the best efficiency numbers(completion%, touchdown%, and interception%)\nOn the other hand, Jackson and Purdy were both outside the top 15 in total volume. Can someone be the most valuable player if they rank in the lower half for the most valuable type of play? For QBs like Jackson who provide elite scrambling ability, yes. For QBs like Purdy who are primarily pocket passers, no.\n\n\nCode\nqb_airyards_yac &lt;- read_csv(\"qbs_airyards_yac.csv\") |&gt;\n  mutate(Player=gsub(\"\\\\*\",\"\",Player)) |&gt;\n  mutate(Player=gsub(\"\\\\+\",\"\",Player))\n\nmvps &lt;- c(\"Dak Prescott\", \"Lamar Jackson\", \"Josh Allen\", \"Brock Purdy\")\n\nmvp_airyards_yac &lt;- qb_airyards_yac |&gt;\n  filter(Player %in% mvps) |&gt;\n  select(Player, CAY, `CAY/Cmp`, `CAY/PA`, YAC, `YAC/Cmp`)\n\nmvp_airyards_yac |&gt;\n  gt() |&gt;\n  cols_label(\n    CAY = \"Completed Air Yards\",\n    `CAY/Cmp`= \"Completed Air Yards Per Completion\",\n    `CAY/PA`= \"Completed Air Yards Per Pass\",\n    YAC = \"Yards After Catch\",\n    `YAC/Cmp`= \"Yards After Catch Per Completion\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"In a league becoming more and more pass happy not all passing yards are similar.\",\n    subtitle = \"Which candidates get their yards through the air compared to teammates getting them after the catch.\"\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")) |&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Dillon Siders  |  **Source:** https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2023/passing_advanced.htm#\")) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12))) |&gt;\n  opt_row_striping() |&gt; \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\")  |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"green\", weight = \"bold\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(CAY),\n      rows = CAY == 2553)) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"red\", weight = \"bold\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(CAY),\n      rows = CAY == 1926)) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"green\", weight = \"bold\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(`CAY/Cmp`),\n      rows = `CAY/Cmp` == 7.2)) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"red\", weight = \"bold\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(`CAY/Cmp`),\n      rows = `CAY/Cmp` == 6.1)) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"green\", weight = \"bold\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(`CAY/PA`),\n      rows = `CAY/PA` == 5.0)) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"red\", weight = \"bold\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(`CAY/PA`),\n      rows = `CAY/PA` == 4.0)) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"green\", weight = \"bold\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(YAC),\n      rows = YAC == 1752)) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"red\", weight = \"bold\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(YAC),\n      rows = YAC == 2054)) |&gt;\n   tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"green\", weight = \"bold\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(`YAC/Cmp`),\n      rows = `YAC/Cmp` == 4.8)) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"red\", weight = \"bold\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(`YAC/Cmp`),\n      rows = `YAC/Cmp` == 6.7)) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"purple\", weight = \"bold\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(Player),\n      rows = Player == \"Lamar Jackson\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a league becoming more and more pass happy not all passing yards are similar.\n\n\nWhich candidates get their yards through the air compared to teammates getting them after the catch.\n\n\nPlayer\nCompleted Air Yards\nCompleted Air Yards Per Completion\nCompleted Air Yards Per Pass\nYards After Catch\nYards After Catch Per Completion\n\n\n\n\nDak Prescott\n2553\n6.2\n4.3\n1963\n4.8\n\n\nJosh Allen\n2337\n6.1\n4.0\n1969\n5.1\n\n\nBrock Purdy\n2226\n7.2\n5.0\n2054\n6.7\n\n\nLamar Jackson\n1926\n6.3\n4.2\n1752\n5.7\n\n\n\nBy: Dillon Siders | Source: https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2023/passing_advanced.htm#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen looking at how good of a passer a QB is base stats are not the only thing you want to look at because they do not tell the entire story. For this, we have other metrics like completed air yards(CAY) and yards after catch(YAC). These help show how much assistance a quarterback gets in gaining their yards.\nHere we see Dak Prescott make his case for best QB through the air in 2023 leading candidates in CAY while getting the least help per reception through YAC. On the flip side, Brock Purdy is the only candidate with 2000 plus YAC on the year.\nThese differences can be caused by lots of things, but the most common ones are offensive scheming and skill position talent. Take the 49ers for example. Their offense is designed around getting their skills players room to generate YAC. Pair that with elite YAC weapons like Christian McCaffrey, Deebo Samuel, Brandon Aiyuk, and George Kittle you have the recipe for easy yardage. The Ravens are somewhat similar to the 49ers on offense just without all the elite talent around the QB.\nPrescott and Allen aren’t as fortunate. Whether it be offensive scheming or subpar weapons these QBs cannot rely on YAC like the other two.\nThe most important part of playing QB has to be accuracy. How can an offense function at full force with a signal caller who constantly misses open receivers or throws it to the defense?\n\n\nCode\nqb_advanced_accuracy &lt;- read_csv(\"qbs_advanced_accuracy.csv\") |&gt; \n  mutate(Player=gsub(\"\\\\*\",\"\",Player)) |&gt;\n  mutate(Player=gsub(\"\\\\+\",\"\",Player)) |&gt; \n  mutate(`Drop%`=gsub(\"%\",\"\",`Drop%`)) |&gt; \n  mutate(`Bad%`=gsub(\"%\",\"\",`Bad%`)) |&gt; \n  mutate(`OnTgt%`=gsub(\"%\",\"\",`OnTgt%`)) |&gt; \n  mutate(`OnTgt%` = as.numeric(`OnTgt%`)) |&gt; \n  mutate(`Bad%` = as.numeric(`Bad%`))\n\nmvps &lt;- c(\"Dak Prescott\", \"Lamar Jackson\", \"Josh Allen\", \"Brock Purdy\")\n\nmvp_accuracy &lt;- qb_advanced_accuracy |&gt;\n  filter(Player %in% mvps) |&gt;\n  select(Player, Drops, `Drop%`, BadTh, `Bad%`, OnTgt, `OnTgt%`)\n\nmvp_accuracy |&gt;\n  gt() |&gt;\n  cols_label(\n    BadTh = \"Bad Throws\",\n    `Bad%`= \"Bad Throw%\",\n    OnTgt = \"On Target Throws\",\n    `OnTgt%` = \"On Target Throw%\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Grading QB accuracy goes far beyond completion percentage and interceptions.\",\n    subtitle = \"Which MVP candidates truly kept the ball on target and out of harms way.\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Dillon Siders  |  **Source:** https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2023/passing_advanced.htm#\")) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12))) |&gt;\n  opt_row_striping() |&gt; \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\") |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"green\", weight = \"bold\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(Drops),\n      rows = Drops == 9)) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"red\", weight = \"bold\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(Drops),\n      rows = Drops == 38)) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"green\", weight = \"bold\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(BadTh),\n      rows = BadTh == 68)) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"red\", weight = \"bold\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(BadTh),\n      rows = BadTh == 78)) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"green\", weight = \"bold\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(`Drop%`),\n      rows = `Drop%` &lt; 2.11)) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"red\", weight = \"bold\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(`Drop%`),\n      rows = `Drop%` &gt; 6.59)) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"green\", weight = \"bold\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(`Bad%`),\n      rows = `Bad%` == 11.7)) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"red\", weight = \"bold\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(`Bad%`),\n      rows = `Bad%` == 16.6)) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"green\", weight = \"bold\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(OnTgt),\n      rows = OnTgt == 479)) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"red\", weight = \"bold\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(OnTgt),\n      rows = OnTgt == 324)) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"green\", weight = \"bold\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(`OnTgt%`),\n      rows = `OnTgt%` == 82.6)) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"red\", weight = \"bold\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(`OnTgt%`),\n      rows = `OnTgt%` == 73.9)) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"purple\", weight = \"bold\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(Player),\n      rows = Player == \"Lamar Jackson\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrading QB accuracy goes far beyond completion percentage and interceptions.\n\n\nWhich MVP candidates truly kept the ball on target and out of harms way.\n\n\nPlayer\nDrops\nDrop%\nBad Throws\nBad Throw%\nOn Target Throws\nOn Target Throw%\n\n\n\n\nDak Prescott\n38\n6.60\n68\n11.7\n479\n82.6\n\n\nJosh Allen\n31\n5.60\n78\n14.2\n427\n77.8\n\n\nBrock Purdy\n9\n2.10\n70\n16.3\n324\n75.5\n\n\nLamar Jackson\n22\n5.00\n73\n16.6\n326\n73.9\n\n\n\nBy: Dillon Siders | Source: https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2023/passing_advanced.htm#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccuracy is not just a player’s completion percentage. There a plenty of outside factors that can worsen a QBs completion percentage that are uncontrollable like drops, throwaways, and spikes. Stats like bad throw percentage(BT%) and on-target throw percentage(OnTgt%) can show you true accuracy taking uncontrolables into account.\nSurprise, Surprise once again Dak Prescott outclasses his competition. In all seriousness Dak Prescott not only was the most accurate QB in 2023, but he also kept the ball out of harm’s way better than anyone else ranking second in BT% and first in OnTgt% for the 2023 season. Josh Allen was the only comparable candidate in these stats ranking 7th in BT% and 10th in OnTgt%.\nIn comparison, the MVP had the worst BT% and OnTgt% of all the candidates. Jackson ranked outside the top 20 in both of these categories. Purdy wasn’t much better than Jackson here ranking 21st in BT% and 17th in OnTgt% for 2023.\nWhile basic stats, air yards, YAC, and advanced accuracy are great starting points there is a better way to evaluate QB thanks to the modern, analytics-based league. For this, we use the holy stat of NFL debate EPA/play.\n\n\nCode\nmvp_weekley_epa_advanced &lt;- read_csv(\"MVP_weekly_epa_advanced.csv\") |&gt;\n  mutate(`Success rate`=gsub(\"%\",\"\",`Success rate`)) |&gt; \n  mutate(`Success rate` = as.numeric(`Success rate`))\n\ndak &lt;- mvp_weekley_epa_advanced |&gt; filter(Player == \"Dak Prescott\")\nlamar &lt;- mvp_weekley_epa_advanced |&gt; filter(Player == \"Lamar Jackson\")\njosh &lt;- mvp_weekley_epa_advanced |&gt; filter(Player == \"Josh Allen\")\nbrock &lt;- mvp_weekley_epa_advanced |&gt; filter(Player == \"Brock Purdy\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_line(data=mvp_weekley_epa_advanced, aes(x=Week, y=`EPA/play`, color=Player), alpha=.4) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.057, alpha = .6) +\n  geom_point(data= dak, aes(x=Week, y=`EPA/play`), color=\"navy\", alpha=.4) +\n  geom_point(data= lamar, aes(x=Week, y=`EPA/play`), color=\"purple\") +\n  geom_point(data= josh, aes(x=Week, y=`EPA/play`), color=\"blue\", alpha=.3) +\n  geom_point(data= brock, aes(x=Week, y=`EPA/play`), color=\"red\", alpha=.3) + \n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18)) +\n  scale_color_manual(values=c(\"red\", \"navy\", \"blue\", \"purple\")) +\n  labs(\n    x= \"Week\",\n    y= \"Expected Points Added Per Play\",\n    title = \"Did Lamar Jackson truly dominate competition on a\\ndown to down basis this year?\",\n    subtitle = \"While Lamar played well other QB were just as good if not better over the entire season.\",\n    caption = \"Source: https://rbsdm.com/stats/stats/ | By: Dillon Siders\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEPA/play or expected points added per play is an advanced stat that evaluates a player’s down-to-down efficiency while factoring down, distance, and situation. This is calculated by taking the difference between expected points before the play and expected points after it’s over.\nThis is important for the MVP race because EPA/play has been crucial to predicting the MVP. The last time a QB won the MVP award and was not the league leader in EPA/play was in 2015 when Cam Newton won it for the Panthers.\nIn 2023, the EPA/play leader on the season was Brock Purdy, followed by Dak Prescott in 2nd, and Josh Allen in 3rd. If they rounded off the top 3 Lamar had to be 4th right? Wrong, Jackson came in at 8th behind Kirk Cousins(6th) and Jalen Hurts(7th).\nOver the course of the entire season, Lamar Jackson was not even the most efficient player at his position let alone in the entire NFL. According to EPA/play it seems like Jackson’s MVP campaign was built on a blowout win against the 49ers in week 16 where he was slightly above average and the demolition against the Dolphins the next week where he was otherworldly.\nWhile EPA/play by itself is a great measure when you combine it with others it paints an even clearer picture. When paired together EPA/play and completion percentage over expected(CPOE) can show you a quarterback’s down-to-down efficiency and accuracy.\n\n\nCode\nall_qb_season &lt;- read_csv(\"all_qb_season_epa_advanced.csv\") |&gt; \n  mutate(`Success rate`=gsub(\"%\",\"\",`Success rate`)) |&gt; \n  mutate(`Success rate` = as.numeric(`Success rate`))\n\ndak_epa &lt;- all_qb_season |&gt; filter(Player == \"D.Prescott\")\nlamar_epa &lt;- all_qb_season |&gt; filter(Player == \"L.Jackson\")\njosh_epa &lt;- all_qb_season |&gt; filter(Player == \"J.Allen\")\nbrock_epa &lt;- all_qb_season |&gt; filter(Player == \"B.Purdy\")\n\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data=all_qb_season, aes(x=`EPA+CPOE composite`, y=`Success rate`), color=\"grey\") +\n  geom_point(data=dak_epa, aes(x=`EPA+CPOE composite`, y=`Success rate`), color=\"navy\") +\n  geom_point(data=lamar_epa, aes(x=`EPA+CPOE composite`, y=`Success rate`), color=\"purple\", size=3) +\n  geom_point(data=josh_epa, aes(x=`EPA+CPOE composite`, y=`Success rate`), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_point(data=brock_epa, aes(x=`EPA+CPOE composite`, y=`Success rate`), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 46.59333) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 0.08086667) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=0.195, y=55.5, label=\"Brock Purdy\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=0.175, y=51.5, label=\"Dak Prescott\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=0.14, y=53, label=\"Josh Allen\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=0.10, y=50.85, label=\"Lamar Jackson\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=0.125, y=57, label=\"Efficient and Accurate\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=0.04, y=38, label=\"Inefficient and Inaccurate\") +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Down to Down Efficiency and Accuracy\",\n    y=\"Success Rate\",\n    title= \"As teams look to become more efficient on both sides \\nof the ball, one QB(or coach) might have found the \\nblueprint for sustained success.\",\n    subtitle= \"While all 4 candidates rank at the top of Success Rate, Brock Purdy and Dak Prescott separate themselves from \\nthe competition with down to down accuracy and efficiency.

Success rate is defined as the percentage of plays where EPA is greater than 0. In other words, did the QB keep the offense moving and create productive plays.\nLooking at the entire NFL it’s obvious that these four QBs were the right candidates for MVP. All four of them rank 1-4 in Success Rate. Where they separate themselves is efficiency and accuracy. Purdy blew every other QB out of the water. Prescott separated himself from 3rd and Purdy was still way ahead of him.\nJackson still ranked inside the top 7 in terms of EPA/play and CPOE, but he was worse than the other three candidates. While that is very good, even great it is not MVP level."

    "title": "2024 NBA Draft Prospect Profile: Tidjane Salaun",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The 2024 NBA Draft is one of mystery and uncertainty. Throughout this draft cycle, evaluators have gone back and forth on almost every single player. While one outlet has a player ranked in the top 5 another might not even have them in the lottery. One of these players who seemed to have a gigantic draft range is now solidifying himself as THE upside swing/project player of the 2024 draft for many NBA teams. This player is French wing Tidjane Salaun.\nSalaun is a 6’9-6’10 wing who has tantalizing upside. His mixture of youth and physical tools has teams buzzing and the rumor mill swirling. Recently it has been said that NBA teams are a lot higher on Salaun than the media, usually implying late lottery as his floor on draft night. This was surprising to me.\nIn my previous evaluations, I viewed Salaun as more of a high upside swing in the mid to late 20s than a lottery pick. While he showed some great flashes there was a lot to be desired with Salaun. These recent rumors made me want to rewatch his film and see if I was missing something. After rewatching Salaun I was left with a lot of questions and a lot of intrigue.\nSince this is my first player profile I want to give a little preface on what to expect. I’ll start by going over what I believe to be a prospect’s strengths or the reasons to draft them. After their strengths, I’ll cover their areas of improvement. Finally, I’ll give my high-end NBA role and low-end NBA role for the prospect. I think this helps provide some context for all the possible outcomes for a player. Now, let’s get into one of the most polarizing names of the 2024 NBA draft.\nThe first thing that stood out when watching Salaun was his physical stature. At the spry age of 18 Salaun already looks like one of the biggest players on the court in a professional league. We always see players get an inch or two added to their listed height, but if I had to guess Salaun is closer to 6’10 than 6’8. It’s not only Salaun’s height, but all his athletic tools jump out to me. His mix of height, length, strength, and vertical pop all make him athletically ready for the NBA.\nSince Salaun is, in my opinion, a very raw prospect, there are not a lot of skills that can be pointed to as strengths currently. A lot of Salaun’s evaluation is projection and that is scary for a prospect. One of the things that makes me believe in Salaun’s ability to improve is his work ethic. Outside of his size, his motor is what stood out most. Salaun ran the floor in transition, was active on the offensive glass, and made some plays in passing lanes/as a rotation defender. While he still lacks consistency in those areas Salaun’s willingness to play hard gives me hope in his long-term development.\nNow we start to get into some of the more concerning things about Salaun. I do want to mention that Salaun is one of those “late-bloomers” in terms of draft prospects. Salaun only started playing basketball in recent years compared to some who have played their entire lives. This inexperience is one of the main causes of Salaun’s deficiencies.\nThe area of most importance for Salaun’s NBA future is his jump shot. Most evaluators coin Salaun as a 3-and-D wing meaning that his 3-point shooting is a necessity. Currently, Salaun’s outlook as a shooter is pretty murky. This year he has shot just below 33% on 140 total attempts. While those numbers are pretty underwhelming there are reasons for this. First Salaun just is not consistent yet. I believe in his mechanics, has a high release point, and usually sets his feet well. Second, he doesn’t make shooting easy on himself. Salaun showed that he had tons of confidence in his jumper having a quick trigger in halfcourt and transition. When Salaun was open it did not matter if he was towing the line or a couple of steps behind it, the shot was going up. There were also a few times when Salaun was spotting up where he caught a kick out but did not know what he wanted to do before catching the ball. This resulted in bad misses, sloppy drives, and turnovers.\nAll of these factors make projecting Salaun as a shooter very difficult. I lean to think that he will eventually become a league-average spot-up shooter since I believe in his mechanics. I don’t think I can project him as a movement shooter or pull-up shooter because his mechanics were very inconsistent on the move and poor ballhandling.\nContinuing with Salaun’s scoring he has yet to show any type of midrange game and minimal stuff as a finisher. Once again I’ll bring up Salaun’s touch or lack thereof. While Salaun has some touch on his jumper and as a finisher, I would call them flashes more than skills. This paired with a shaky handle and low feel makes it hard for me to see him improving at creating pull-up opportunities or consistently getting to the rim. Luckily for Salaun his size, length, and athleticism can make up for some of the issues.\nThe final part of Salaun’s offensive game to analyze is his passing and playmaking. I’ll keep this short, it’s pretty bad. This area of Salaun’s game is the one most impacted by this inexperience. On the year Salaun had 34 assists to 50 turnovers, not great. On film, it looked to be more about lack of feel than being a bad/unwilling passer. With Salaun it just looked like the game moved a tick too fast at times. Either he would take too long to make decisions or pre-determine them. Usually, I believe that feel is something that cannot be taught, but Salaun is slightly different because of his inexperience. As he accumulates more minutes on the court and learns under NBA coaches he could develop a better understanding of the nuances of basketball.\nOn defense, Salaun is once again a work in progress. Like most other parts of his game, the physical tools and motor give him the perfect starting point to become a great defender. Being 6’9 with long arms should allow him to be disruptive off-ball in passing lanes or contesting help side. A mixture of vertical pop and strength also gives Salaun the potential to eventually guard bigs.\nIn its current state Salaun’s defense would likely keep him off an NBA court in any game that matters. Similar to his playmaking, Salaun’s defense is affected by his lack of natural basketball feel. I don’t know if there was a single-shot fake that he did not jump at this season. That paired with messy closeouts and bad footwork led to a good amount of blowbyes. As Salaun gets older hopefully he stops jumping at so many pump fakes and cleans up the other aspects he could become a solid defender.\nAfter reevaluating Tidjane Salaun’s film I was left with a lot of the same takeaways, but also some newfound intrigue. He still has a long way to go as a player before making an impact, but there are not many upside swings I would take in Salaun’s range over him. While he only moved from a late first-early second on my board to the 22-25 range I can see why a team would take him sooner.\nIn this age of the NBA big, athletic wings that shoot and play defense are some of the most valuable players in the league. Salaun is one of the best bets to become that in this mysterious draft class so do not be surprised if an NBA team gambles on his upside come draft night. If Salaun can capitalize on his physical tools I could see him playing a role similar to Michael Porter Jr of the Denver Nuggets. If he can’t develop I could see him having a fairly short NBA career."

    "title": "Despite the youth and inexperience the Oklahoma City Thunder fielded one of the top teams in the NBA this year and established themselves as true title contenders in the wild Western Conference.",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This year in the NBA we were treated to one of the most competitive Western Conferences ever. By the time all the postseason teams (playoff and play-in) were set every team in the West had at least 46 wins. Even the eleven-seed Houston Rockets finished 41-41 which would’ve been good enough for the nine-seed in the East.\nIn a conference this competitive it can be hard to tell which teams are the cream of the crop. Every day these great teams clashed creating some great basketball, but it made it hard to discern who truly was the best team in the West.\nFor most NBA watchers, the choice was the Denver Nuggets. Looking to win back-to-back championships behind the wizardry of Nikola Jokic they played great this year but showed some regression cracking the door for other teams. Two teams, in particular, decided to break it down with a battering ram.\nBoth the Oklahoma City Thunder and Minnesota Timberwolves made tremendous leaps in terms of team success this year. Minnesota turned last year’s 42-win first-round exit into 56 wins and the 3rd seed. OKC made an even larger jump going from a sub .500 record(40-42) to the No.1 seed in the entire conference.\nEven though OKC and Minnesota had phenomenal regular seasons many still believe that Denver is still the favorite. To get a better look at how well teams performed over the season we can look at the standings seeding over the entire season.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(hoopR)\nlibrary(ggbump)\n\nrecordbyweek &lt;- read.csv(\"nba_standings_by_week.csv\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_bump(data=recordbyweek, aes(x=Week, y=Rank, color=Team)) +\n  geom_point(data=recordbyweek, aes(x=Week, y=Rank, color=Team), size=2) +\n  geom_text(data = recordbyweek |&gt; filter(Week == max(Week)), aes(x = Week + .5, y=Rank, label = Team), size = 3, hjust = 0) +\n  scale_color_manual(values=c(\"blue\", \"#FFC627\", \"lightgrey\", \"lightgrey\", \"black\", \"purple\", \"lightgrey\", \"#78BE20\", \"red\", \"#007AC1\", \"orange\", \"lightgrey\", \"lightgrey\", \"lightgrey\", \"lightgrey\", \"lightgrey\")) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25), limits = c(1, 33.45)) +\n  scale_y_reverse(breaks=c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15)) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Week\",\n    y=\"Standings Rank\",\n    title=\"Western Confernece playoff teams standings \\nplacement throughtout the season\",\n    subtitle = \"OKC, Denver, and Minnesota were consistently atop the west all year.\",\n    caption = \"Source: https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2024_standings_by_date_western_conference.html | By:Dillon Siders\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n    panel.grid.major = element_blank()\n  ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeading into the playoffs the standings finished with the Thunder 1st, the Nuggets 2nd, and the Timberwolves 3rd, but it was a lot closer than that. OKC and Denver finished with the same record of 57-25 and Minnesota was one game behind at 56-26.\nThis was somewhat unfortunate for the Timberwolves since they held the top seed for the most amount of time during the season before slipping up down the stretch. OKC followed suit by staying in 2nd most of the year before stealing 1st. Denver, on the other hand, was less consistent than both.\nFor most of the season, Denver hovered between 3rd and 4th. Even though they were less consistent than the Timberwolves and Thunder they managed to keep teams like the Mavericks and Clippers from holding a top 3 seed for more than a week or two at a time. The consistency throughout 82 games shows how dominant these teams were compared to the rest of the West.\nAnother way to show how OKC, Denver, and Minnesota dominated the Western Conference this year is their season point differential. A teams total point differential can give insight into whether they outclassed their competition consistently, or if they scraped by with hard-fought wins.\n\n\nCode\nnbabox2024 &lt;- load_nba_team_box(2024)\n\nnewnbabox2024 &lt;- nbabox2024 |&gt; \n  mutate(pointdiff=team_score-opponent_team_score) |&gt; \n  arrange(game_date) |&gt; \n  group_by(team_display_name) |&gt; \n  mutate(cumpointdiff=cumsum(pointdiff)) \n\nplayoffteams &lt;- c(\"Oklahoma City Thunder\", \"Denver Nuggets\", \"Minnesota Timberwolves\", \"LA Clippers\", \"Dallas Mavericks\", \"Phoenix Suns\", \"Los Angeles Lakers\", \"New Orleans Pelicans\", \"Boston Celtics\", \"New York Knicks\", \"Milwaukee Bucks\", \"Cleveland Cavaliers\", \"Orlando Magic\", \"Indiana Pacers\", \"Philadelphia 76ers\", \"Miami Heat\")\n\nplayoffs &lt;- newnbabox2024 |&gt; \n  filter(team_display_name %in% playoffteams) \n\nbos &lt;- playoffs |&gt; filter(team_display_name == \"Boston Celtics\")\nokc &lt;- playoffs |&gt; filter(team_display_name == \"Oklahoma City Thunder\")\nmin &lt;- playoffs |&gt; filter(team_display_name == \"Minnesota Timberwolves\")\nden &lt;- playoffs |&gt; filter(team_display_name == \"Denver Nuggets\")\nlac &lt;- playoffs |&gt; filter(team_display_name == \"LA Clippers\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_step(data=playoffs, aes(x=game_date, y=cumpointdiff, group=team_display_name), color=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_step(data=bos, aes(x=game_date, y=cumpointdiff, group=team_display_name), color=\"#007A33\") +\n  geom_step(data=okc, aes(x=game_date, y=cumpointdiff, group=team_display_name), color=\"#007AC1\") +\n  geom_step(data=min, aes(x=game_date, y=cumpointdiff, group=team_display_name), color=\"#78BE20\") +\n  geom_step(data=den, aes(x=game_date, y=cumpointdiff, group=team_display_name), color=\"#FFC627\") +\n  geom_step(data=lac, aes(x=game_date, y=cumpointdiff, group=team_display_name), color=\"black\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=as.Date(\"2024-02-15\"), y=630, label=\"Celtics\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=as.Date(\"2024-03-21\"), y=572, label=\"Thunder\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=as.Date(\"2024-03-13\"), y=393, label=\"Timberwolves\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=as.Date(\"2024-04-23\"), y=400, label=\"Nuggets\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=as.Date(\"2024-04-20\"), y=310, label=\"Clippers\") +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Date\",\n    y=\"Cumulative Point Differential\",\n    title=\"Youth shines in the Western Conference\",\n    subtitle=\"The Thunder stand atop the West in point differential despite being the second youngest team in the league.\",\n    caption=\"Source: hoopR | By: Dillon Siders\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cumulative point differential once again shows that the Thunder, Timberwolves, and Nuggets were the top 3 teams in the West.

Even though the Nuggets were below the Thunder and Timberwolves they were well ahead of the 4th-seeded Clippers by a couple hundred points.\nWhile point differential is great to measure a team’s consistency it is not the only way to predict playoff success.

Although they separated themselves the Timberwolves did it differently than the Thunder and Nuggets.\nThis year Minnesota had the best defense in the NBA by a fairly large margin. Their defensive identity pairs perfectly with rising superstar Anthony Edwards’ electric offensive game creating the perfect storm. OKC and Denver took slightly different approaches.\nNeither OKC nor Denver can match Minnesota’s defense because they do not have the personnel to do it. Minnesota starts two 7-footers, a 6’10 wing, and brings another big off the bench as their 6th man. OKC and Denver do not possess the same size, but that doesn’t make them much worse at defense.\nWhere OKC and Denver lack on defense they make up for it in offense. While all three teams finished in the top 8 in defensive rating, only OKC and Denver did that for offensive rating, both finishing top 5. Minnesota ended the season ranked 16th on offense.\nThis is again because of team personnel. Minnesota heavily relies on one player to generate most of their offense, that being Anthony Edwards. OKC and Denver can play a more balanced way because they each have multiple great shot-creators and rely more on ball/player movement.\nIn a Western Conference as competitive as this it is hard to predict what will and won’t happen. Those predictions get even harder come playoff time when everything is turned up a level. This is why saying a team like the Thunder can’t compete even though they stack up well against the defending champions and the rest of the conference can be shortsighted."

    "title": "2024 NBA Draft Prospect Profile: Nikola Topic",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In recent years we have seen an influx of foreign talent enter the NBA. Some of the best players in the league like Giannis Antetekounmpo, Joel Embiid, and Luka Doncic hail from outside the US. While not every country is producing tons of basketball talent some like France have produced tons of NBA players over the last few years.\nAnother country like France that has seen an increase in NBA success among their players is Serbia. Not only is Serbia the home of the current best player in the world Nikola Jokic, but also other NBA role players like Bogdan Bogdanovic and Nikola Jovic. This summer Nikola Topic looks to become the newest Serbian to make his mark in the NBA.\nNikola Topic has been a top prospect in the 2024 draft since the start of the cycle. The 6’6 point guard provides a lot of the things NBA front offices covet in a lead initiator especially since he won’t turn 19 until after the draft. Topic had an up-and-down year showcasing his on-ball potential at Mega before getting called back to Red Star where a couple of injuries derailed the end of his season. Topic’s combination of skills gives him the potential to return top-5 value to a team that drafts him provided they properly manage his development.\nScoring/Shooting Right now Nikola Topic’s scoring is predicated on his driving ability. This year playing with Mega, Topic lived in the paint. He is able to pressure the rim without traditional athleticism instead using his IQ, pace, and craft. He can use creative finishing angles and good body control to counter rim protectors. Topic also has great command of the pick and roll and is great at using it to get downhill. It should be noted that Topic is exclusively finishing below the rim and his underwhelming athleticism could cause struggles early on in the NBA.\nOutside of Topic’s finishing, he does not have another area where he can consistently generate offense. His questionable jump shot will allow teams to sag off and go under screens early. Not having a reliable jump shot also limits the impact Topic has off-ball. There are some positive indicators that his jump shot will improve like all-around good touch and a high free throw percentage, but his shooting form has left some questions.\nWhile I do not think that Topic has an ugly jumper by any means there are some improvements he could make. The biggest one for me is the arc on his shots. It was easy to tell the makes from the misses just by the arc alone. When Topic got air under the ball his jumper looked normal, but most of the time his shots were closer to a line drive than a pop fly. Even without a consistent 3-point shot, I can still see Topic becoming an impactful NBA player, but without some way to keep the defense honest there could be a major cap on his ceiling.\nPassing/Playmaking The area where evaluators are most impressed by Topic is his passing. While at Mega he starred as their primary ball handler and offensive initiator. His elite vision and quick decision-making perfectly complement his skills as a driver, finisher, and pick-and-roll ball handler. Topic best displays this when he’s able to use his gravity as a driver to draw in defenders before dishing to an open shooter or big.\nFew in the class rival Topic’s vision, but nobody can match his passing versatility. In my opinion, Topic is the best passer/playmaker in this class because of the sheer amount of passes he can make and his current age. It is rare to see players have the amount of playmaking skill Topic has at his age. He finds teammates in transition, spotting up, rolling to the rim, and along the baseline/in the dunker spot.\nThe final thing that makes Topic a great playmaker is his natural basketball feel. When Topic has the ball in his hands it feels like has absolute command of the offense. It feels like he knows what a defense is going to do before they do it. His high understanding of how defenses react and live dribble passing skills let him make passes other players do not even dream of attempting.\nDefense Even though I am a big believer in Nikola Topic’s offensive game his defense leaves me with a lot of questions. Right away Topic is a subpar athlete with a negative wingspan which immediately limits his defensive upside. His athletic limitations mostly hurt him as an on-ball defender. Poor lateral agility and technique make it unlikely Topic ever guards on ball and poor measurables make off-ball impact questionable at best.\nOver the year Topic registered a 1.8 steal% and 0.5 block% which are underwhelming, but the sell on Topic has always been his offense anyway. I definitely think there are paths for Topic to survive on defense off the ball. His high basketball IQ and feel should eventually allow Topic to make an impact off the ball as long as he maintains proper positioning. Teams can also make his life easier on defense by surrounding him with plus defenders.\nOverall Outlook There has been some unfortunate news around Topic as of late that might affect his stock on draft night. Recently it was revealed that Topic suffered a partially torn ACL at the international combine in Treviso Italy. On top of this Topic had another knee injury earlier this year. It has been stated that this should not cause his draft stock to drop, but the NBA is crazy, especially around draft time. As long as the team that selects Topic gives him proper treatment and rest he should be able to debut sometime this upcoming season. Even if he doesn’t play next year we have seen rookies sit out their first year and still become great NBA players.\nAt the start of this draft cycle Topic was as high as my No.1 player in the draft. Though I have cooled some on Topic I still have him as a top-10 player in this year’s class. I would be willing to bet on his passing/playmaking skills, natural basketball IQ, and feel for the game especially since he won’t turn 19 until after draft night.\nIn the NBA I can see two paths that Topic’s career can take. Obviously, there are other outcomes besides the ones I see, but those paths are less clear than the ones I’m mentioning. The first is his high-end outcome where he is a team’s lead guard and initiator. In this role, he would be a high-volume pick-and-roll ball handler who uses his IQ and vision to set up teammates. Topic’s low-end outcome probably looks similar to a Josh Giddey-type player. Even without a reliable jump shot I find it hard for a player as smart as Topic to not find some role in the NBA."
