    "text": "2023 was an interesting year for NFL offenses and QBs. After years of consistent improvement in QB play this year was different. This down year at the QB position contributed to one of the weirdest MVP races in recent memory.\nBaltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson ended up winning the 2023 NFL MVP award in a landslide securing 49 of the 50 first-place votes. Jackson was critical to the Ravens’ success this year leading them to a 13-3 record, the best in the NFL, but he lacked some of the other criteria that past MVP had.\nWhile you cannot question Jackson’s impact on the Ravens you can question if he was the “most valuable” player in the NFL. Multiple other QBs put up similar or superior individual stats but fell short in the team success category.\nSo, how do you evaluate which player brings more value than another? That’s the hard part.\nA starting point is evaluating which plays are more valuable than others. Since the revolution of the passing game, passing plays have become more efficient and effective than rushing plays.\nThis can be displayed by the average expected points added per play(EPA/play) for passing and rushing plays. On the season only three teams had a positive EPA/play on rushing plays, the 49ers, Ravens, and Bills. This means on average only the 49ers, Ravens, and Bills increase their odds of scoring when they run the ball.\nNow that we know what play type brings more value we can dive into the numbers and we’ll see which MVP candidates brought the most value.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggtext)\n\nqb_raw_stats &lt;- read_csv(\"qbrawstats.csv\") |&gt;\n  mutate(Player=gsub(\"\\\\*\",\"\",Player)) |&gt;\n  mutate(Player=gsub(\"\\\\+\",\"\",Player))\n\nmvps &lt;- c(\"Dak Prescott\", \"Lamar Jackson\", \"Josh Allen\", \"Brock Purdy\")\n\nmvp &lt;- qb_raw_stats |&gt;

Dak Prescott dominated basic throwing stats. Not only did he lead in total passing volume(completions and attempts) but he posted some of the best efficiency numbers(completion%, touchdown%, and interception%)\nOn the other hand, Jackson and Purdy were both outside the top 15 in total volume. Can someone be the most valuable player if they rank in the lower half for the most valuable type of play? For QBs like Jackson who provide elite scrambling ability, yes. For QBs like Purdy who are primarily pocket passers, no.\n\n\nCode\nqb_airyards_yac &lt;- read_csv(\"qbs_airyards_yac.csv\") |&gt;\n  mutate(Player=gsub(\"\\\\*\",\"\",Player)) |&gt;\n  mutate(Player=gsub(\"\\\\+\",\"\",Player))\n\nmvps &lt;- c(\"Dak Prescott\", \"Lamar Jackson\", \"Josh Allen\", \"Brock Purdy\")\n\nmvp_airyards_yac &lt;- qb_airyards_yac |&gt;\n  filter(Player %in% mvps) |&gt;\n  select(Player, CAY, `CAY/Cmp`, `CAY/PA`, YAC, `YAC/Cmp`)\n\nmvp_airyards_yac |&gt;\n  gt() |&gt;\n  cols_label(\n    CAY = \"Completed Air Yards\",\n    `CAY/Cmp`= \"Completed Air Yards Per Completion\",\n    `CAY/PA`= \"Completed Air Yards Per Pass\",\n    YAC = \"Yards After Catch\",\n    `YAC/Cmp`= \"Yards After Catch Per Completion\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"In a league becoming more and more pass happy not all passing yards are similar.\",\n    subtitle = \"Which candidates get their yards through the air compared to teammates getting them after the catch.\"\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")) |&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Dillon Siders  |  **Source:** https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2023/passing_advanced.htm#\")) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12))) |&gt;\n  opt_row_striping() |&gt; \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\")  |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"green\", weight = \"bold\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(CAY),\n      rows = CAY == 2553)) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"red\", weight = \"bold\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(CAY),\n      rows = CAY == 1926)) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"green\", weight = \"bold\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(`CAY/Cmp`),\n      rows = `CAY/Cmp` == 7.2)) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"red\", weight = \"bold\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(`CAY/Cmp`),\n      rows = `CAY/Cmp` == 6.1)) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"green\", weight = \"bold\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(`CAY/PA`),\n      rows = `CAY/PA` == 5.0)) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"red\", weight = \"bold\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(`CAY/PA`),\n      rows = `CAY/PA` == 4.0)) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"green\", weight = \"bold\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(YAC),\n      rows = YAC == 1752)) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"red\", weight = \"bold\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(YAC),\n      rows = YAC == 2054)) |&gt;\n   tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"green\", weight = \"bold\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(`YAC/Cmp`),\n      rows = `YAC/Cmp` == 4.8)) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"red\", weight = \"bold\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(`YAC/Cmp`),\n      rows = `YAC/Cmp` == 6.7)) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"purple\", weight = \"bold\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(Player),\n      rows = Player == \"Lamar Jackson\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a league becoming more and more pass happy not all passing yards are similar.\n\n\nWhich candidates get their yards through the air compared to teammates getting them after the catch.\n\n\nPlayer\nCompleted Air Yards\nCompleted Air Yards Per Completion\nCompleted Air Yards Per Pass\nYards After Catch\nYards After Catch Per Completion\n\n\n\n\nDak Prescott\n2553\n6.2\n4.3\n1963\n4.8\n\n\nJosh Allen\n2337\n6.1\n4.0\n1969\n5.1\n\n\nBrock Purdy\n2226\n7.2\n5.0\n2054\n6.7\n\n\nLamar Jackson\n1926\n6.3\n4.2\n1752\n5.7\n\n\n\nBy: Dillon Siders | Source: https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2023/passing_advanced.htm#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen looking at how good of a passer a QB is base stats are not the only thing you want to look at because they do not tell the entire story. For this, we have other metrics like completed air yards(CAY) and yards after catch(YAC). These help show how much assistance a quarterback gets in gaining their yards.\nHere we see Dak Prescott make his case for best QB through the air in 2023 leading candidates in CAY while getting the least help per reception through YAC. On the flip side, Brock Purdy is the only candidate with 2000 plus YAC on the year.\nThese differences can be caused by lots of things, but the most common ones are offensive scheming and skill position talent. Take the 49ers for example. Their offense is designed around getting their skills players room to generate YAC. Pair that with elite YAC weapons like Christian McCaffrey, Deebo Samuel, Brandon Aiyuk, and George Kittle you have the recipe for easy yardage. The Ravens are somewhat similar to the 49ers on offense just without all the elite talent around the QB.\nPrescott and Allen aren’t as fortunate. Whether it be offensive scheming or subpar weapons these QBs cannot rely on YAC like the other two.\nThe most important part of playing QB has to be accuracy. How can an offense function at full force with a signal caller who constantly misses open receivers or throws it to the defense?\n\n\nCode\nqb_advanced_accuracy &lt;- read_csv(\"qbs_advanced_accuracy.csv\") |&gt; \n  mutate(Player=gsub(\"\\\\*\",\"\",Player)) |&gt;\n  mutate(Player=gsub(\"\\\\+\",\"\",Player)) |&gt; \n  mutate(`Drop%`=gsub(\"%\",\"\",`Drop%`)) |&gt; \n  mutate(`Bad%`=gsub(\"%\",\"\",`Bad%`)) |&gt; \n  mutate(`OnTgt%`=gsub(\"%\",\"\",`OnTgt%`)) |&gt; \n  mutate(`OnTgt%` = as.numeric(`OnTgt%`)) |&gt; \n  mutate(`Bad%` = as.numeric(`Bad%`))\n\nmvps &lt;- c(\"Dak Prescott\", \"Lamar Jackson\", \"Josh Allen\", \"Brock Purdy\")\n\nmvp_accuracy &lt;- qb_advanced_accuracy |&gt;\n  filter(Player %in% mvps) |&gt;\n  select(Player, Drops, `Drop%`, BadTh, `Bad%`, OnTgt, `OnTgt%`)\n\nmvp_accuracy |&gt;\n  gt() |&gt;\n  cols_label(\n    BadTh = \"Bad Throws\",\n    `Bad%`= \"Bad Throw%\",\n    OnTgt = \"On Target Throws\",\n    `OnTgt%` = \"On Target Throw%\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Grading QB accuracy goes far beyond completion percentage and interceptions.\",\n    subtitle = \"Which MVP candidates truly kept the ball on target and out of harms way.\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Dillon Siders  |  **Source:** https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2023/passing_advanced.htm#\")) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12))) |&gt;\n  opt_row_striping() |&gt; \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\") |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"green\", weight = \"bold\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(Drops),\n      rows = Drops == 9)) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"red\", weight = \"bold\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(Drops),\n      rows = Drops == 38)) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"green\", weight = \"bold\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(BadTh),\n      rows = BadTh == 68)) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"red\", weight = \"bold\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(BadTh),\n      rows = BadTh == 78)) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"green\", weight = \"bold\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(`Drop%`),\n      rows = `Drop%` &lt; 2.11)) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"red\", weight = \"bold\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(`Drop%`),\n      rows = `Drop%` &gt; 6.59)) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"green\", weight = \"bold\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(`Bad%`),\n      rows = `Bad%` == 11.7)) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"red\", weight = \"bold\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(`Bad%`),\n      rows = `Bad%` == 16.6)) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"green\", weight = \"bold\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(OnTgt),\n      rows = OnTgt == 479)) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"red\", weight = \"bold\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(OnTgt),\n      rows = OnTgt == 324)) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"green\", weight = \"bold\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(`OnTgt%`),\n      rows = `OnTgt%` == 82.6)) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"red\", weight = \"bold\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(`OnTgt%`),\n      rows = `OnTgt%` == 73.9)) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"purple\", weight = \"bold\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(Player),\n      rows = Player == \"Lamar Jackson\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrading QB accuracy goes far beyond completion percentage and interceptions.\n\n\nWhich MVP candidates truly kept the ball on target and out of harms way.\n\n\nPlayer\nDrops\nDrop%\nBad Throws\nBad Throw%\nOn Target Throws\nOn Target Throw%\n\n\n\n\nDak Prescott\n38\n6.60\n68\n11.7\n479\n82.6\n\n\nJosh Allen\n31\n5.60\n78\n14.2\n427\n77.8\n\n\nBrock Purdy\n9\n2.10\n70\n16.3\n324\n75.5\n\n\nLamar Jackson\n22\n5.00\n73\n16.6\n326\n73.9\n\n\n\nBy: Dillon Siders | Source: https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2023/passing_advanced.htm#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccuracy is not just a player’s completion percentage. There a plenty of outside factors that can worsen a QBs completion percentage that are uncontrollable like drops, throwaways, and spikes. Stats like bad throw percentage(BT%) and on-target throw percentage(OnTgt%) can show you true accuracy taking uncontrolables into account.\nSurprise, Surprise once again Dak Prescott outclasses his competition. In all seriousness Dak Prescott not only was the most accurate QB in 2023, but he also kept the ball out of harm’s way better than anyone else ranking second in BT% and first in OnTgt% for the 2023 season. Josh Allen was the only comparable candidate in these stats ranking 7th in BT% and 10th in OnTgt%.\nIn comparison, the MVP had the worst BT% and OnTgt% of all the candidates. Jackson ranked outside the top 20 in both of these categories. Purdy wasn’t much better than Jackson here ranking 21st in BT% and 17th in OnTgt% for 2023.\nWhile basic stats, air yards, YAC, and advanced accuracy are great starting points there is a better way to evaluate QB thanks to the modern, analytics-based league. For this, we use the holy stat of NFL debate EPA/play.\n\n\nCode\nmvp_weekley_epa_advanced &lt;- read_csv(\"MVP_weekly_epa_advanced.csv\") |&gt;\n  mutate(`Success rate`=gsub(\"%\",\"\",`Success rate`)) |&gt; \n  mutate(`Success rate` = as.numeric(`Success rate`))\n\ndak &lt;- mvp_weekley_epa_advanced |&gt; filter(Player == \"Dak Prescott\")\nlamar &lt;- mvp_weekley_epa_advanced |&gt; filter(Player == \"Lamar Jackson\")\njosh &lt;- mvp_weekley_epa_advanced |&gt; filter(Player == \"Josh Allen\")\nbrock &lt;- mvp_weekley_epa_advanced |&gt; filter(Player == \"Brock Purdy\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_line(data=mvp_weekley_epa_advanced, aes(x=Week, y=`EPA/play`, color=Player), alpha=.4) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.057, alpha = .6) +\n  geom_point(data= dak, aes(x=Week, y=`EPA/play`), color=\"navy\", alpha=.4) +\n  geom_point(data= lamar, aes(x=Week, y=`EPA/play`), color=\"purple\") +\n  geom_point(data= josh, aes(x=Week, y=`EPA/play`), color=\"blue\", alpha=.3) +\n  geom_point(data= brock, aes(x=Week, y=`EPA/play`), color=\"red\", alpha=.3) + \n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18)) +\n  scale_color_manual(values=c(\"red\", \"navy\", \"blue\", \"purple\")) +\n  labs(\n    x= \"Week\",\n    y= \"Expected Points Added Per Play\",\n    title = \"Did Lamar Jackson truly dominate competition on a\\ndown to down basis this year?\",\n    subtitle = \"While Lamar played well other QB were just as good if not better over the entire season.\",\n    caption = \"Source: https://rbsdm.com/stats/stats/ | By: Dillon Siders\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEPA/play or expected points added per play is an advanced stat that evaluates a player’s down-to-down efficiency while factoring down, distance, and situation. This is calculated by taking the difference between expected points before the play and expected points after it’s over.\nThis is important for the MVP race because EPA/play has been crucial to predicting the MVP. The last time a QB won the MVP award and was not the league leader in EPA/play was in 2015 when Cam Newton won it for the Panthers.\nIn 2023, the EPA/play leader on the season was Brock Purdy, followed by Dak Prescott in 2nd, and Josh Allen in 3rd. If they rounded off the top 3 Lamar had to be 4th right? Wrong, Jackson came in at 8th behind Kirk Cousins(6th) and Jalen Hurts(7th).\nOver the course of the entire season, Lamar Jackson was not even the most efficient player at his position let alone in the entire NFL. According to EPA/play it seems like Jackson’s MVP campaign was built on a blowout win against the 49ers in week 16 where he was slightly above average and the demolition against the Dolphins the next week where he was otherworldly.\nWhile EPA/play by itself is a great measure when you combine it with others it paints an even clearer picture. When paired together EPA/play and completion percentage over expected(CPOE) can show you a quarterback’s down-to-down efficiency and accuracy.\n\n\nCode\nall_qb_season &lt;- read_csv(\"all_qb_season_epa_advanced.csv\") |&gt; \n  mutate(`Success rate`=gsub(\"%\",\"\",`Success rate`)) |&gt; \n  mutate(`Success rate` = as.numeric(`Success rate`))\n\ndak_epa &lt;- all_qb_season |&gt; filter(Player == \"D.Prescott\")\nlamar_epa &lt;- all_qb_season |&gt; filter(Player == \"L.Jackson\")\njosh_epa &lt;- all_qb_season |&gt; filter(Player == \"J.Allen\")\nbrock_epa &lt;- all_qb_season |&gt; filter(Player == \"B.Purdy\")\n\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data=all_qb_season, aes(x=`EPA+CPOE composite`, y=`Success rate`), color=\"grey\") +\n  geom_point(data=dak_epa, aes(x=`EPA+CPOE composite`, y=`Success rate`), color=\"navy\") +\n  geom_point(data=lamar_epa, aes(x=`EPA+CPOE composite`, y=`Success rate`), color=\"purple\", size=3) +\n  geom_point(data=josh_epa, aes(x=`EPA+CPOE composite`, y=`Success rate`), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_point(data=brock_epa, aes(x=`EPA+CPOE composite`, y=`Success rate`), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 46.59333) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 0.08086667) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=0.195, y=55.5, label=\"Brock Purdy\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=0.175, y=51.5, label=\"Dak Prescott\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=0.14, y=53, label=\"Josh Allen\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=0.10, y=50.85, label=\"Lamar Jackson\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=0.125, y=57, label=\"Efficient and Accurate\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=0.04, y=38, label=\"Inefficient and Inaccurate\") +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Down to Down Efficiency and Accuracy\",\n    y=\"Success Rate\",\n    title= \"As teams look to become more efficient on both sides \\nof the ball, one QB(or coach) might have found the \\nblueprint for sustained success.\",\n    subtitle= \"While all 4 candidates rank at the top of Success Rate, Brock Purdy and Dak Prescott separate themselves from \\nthe competition with down to down accuracy and efficiency.

Success rate is defined as the percentage of plays where EPA is greater than 0. In other words, did the QB keep the offense moving and create productive plays.\nLooking at the entire NFL it’s obvious that these four QBs were the right candidates for MVP. All four of them rank 1-4 in Success Rate. Where they separate themselves is efficiency and accuracy. Purdy blew every other QB out of the water. Prescott separated himself from 3rd and Purdy was still way ahead of him.\nJackson still ranked inside the top 7 in terms of EPA/play and CPOE, but he was worse than the other three candidates. While that is very good, even great it is not MVP level."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This year in the NBA we were treated to one of the most competitive Western Conferences ever. By the time all the postseason teams (playoff and play-in) were set every team in the West had at least 46 wins. Even the eleven-seed Houston Rockets finished 41-41 which would’ve been good enough for the nine-seed in the East.\nIn a conference this competitive it can be hard to tell which teams are the cream of the crop. Every day these great teams clashed creating some great basketball, but it made it hard to discern who truly was the best team in the West.\nFor most NBA watchers, the choice was the Denver Nuggets. Looking to win back-to-back championships behind the wizardry of Nikola Jokic they played great this year but showed some regression cracking the door for other teams. Two teams, in particular, decided to break it down with a battering ram.\nBoth the Oklahoma City Thunder and Minnesota Timberwolves made tremendous leaps in terms of team success this year. Minnesota turned last year’s 42-win first-round exit into 56 wins and the 3rd seed. OKC made an even larger jump going from a sub .500 record(40-42) to the No.1 seed in the entire conference.\nEven though OKC and Minnesota had phenomenal regular seasons many still believe that Denver is still the favorite. To get a better look at how well teams performed over the season we can look at the standings seeding over the entire season.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(hoopR)\nlibrary(ggbump)\n\nrecordbyweek &lt;- read.csv(\"nba_record_by_week.csv\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_bump(data=recordbyweek, aes(x=Week, y=Rank, color=Team)) +\n  geom_point(data=recordbyweek, aes(x=Week, y=Rank, color=Team), size=2) +\n  geom_text(data = recordbyweek |&gt; filter(Week == max(Week)), aes(x = Week + .5, y=Rank, label = Team), size = 3, hjust = 0) +\n  scale_color_manual(values=c(\"blue\", \"#FFC627\", \"lightgrey\", \"lightgrey\", \"black\", \"purple\", \"lightgrey\", \"#78BE20\", \"red\", \"#007AC1\", \"orange\", \"lightgrey\", \"lightgrey\", \"lightgrey\", \"lightgrey\", \"lightgrey\")) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(2,4,6,8,11,13,15,19,21,23,25), limits = c(2, 33.45)) +\n  scale_y_reverse(breaks=c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15)) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Week\",\n    y=\"Standings Rank\",\n    title=\"Western Confernece playoff teams standings \\nplacement throughtout the season.\",\n    subtitle = \"OKC, Denver, and Minnesota were consistently atop the west all year.\",\n    caption = \"Source: https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2024_standings_by_date_western_conference.html | By:Dillon Siders\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n    panel.grid.major = element_blank()\n  ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeading into the playoffs the standings finished with the Thunder 1st, the Nuggets 2nd, and the Timberwolves 3rd, but it was a lot closer than that. OKC and Denver finished with the same record of 57-25 and Minnesota was one game behind at 56-26.\nThis was somewhat unfortunate for the Timberwolves since they held the top seed for the most amount of time during the season before slipping up down the stretch. OKC followed suit by staying in 2nd most of the year before stealing 1st. Denver, on the other hand, was less consistent than both.\nFor most of the season, Denver hovered between 3rd and 4th. Even though they were less consistent than the Timberwolves and Thunder they managed to keep teams like the Mavericks and Clippers from holding a top 3 seed for more than a week or two at a time. The consistency throughout 82 games shows how dominant these teams were compared to the rest of the West.\nAnother way to show how OKC, Denver, and Minnesota dominated the Western Conference this year is their season point differential. A teams total point differential can give insight into whether they outclassed their competition consistently, or if they scraped by with hard-fought wins.\n\n\nCode\nnbabox2024 &lt;- load_nba_team_box(2024)\n\nnewnbabox2024 &lt;- nbabox2024 |&gt; \n  mutate(pointdiff=team_score-opponent_team_score) |&gt; \n  arrange(game_date) |&gt; \n  group_by(team_display_name) |&gt; \n  mutate(cumpointdiff=cumsum(pointdiff)) \n\nplayoffteams &lt;- c(\"Oklahoma City Thunder\", \"Denver Nuggets\", \"Minnesota Timberwolves\", \"LA Clippers\", \"Dallas Mavericks\", \"Phoenix Suns\", \"Los Angeles Lakers\", \"New Orleans Pelicans\", \"Boston Celtics\", \"New York Knicks\", \"Milwaukee Bucks\", \"Cleveland Cavaliers\", \"Orlando Magic\", \"Indiana Pacers\", \"Philadelphia 76ers\", \"Miami Heat\")\n\nplayoffs &lt;- newnbabox2024 |&gt; \n  filter(team_display_name %in% playoffteams) \n\nbos &lt;- playoffs |&gt; filter(team_display_name == \"Boston Celtics\")\nokc &lt;- playoffs |&gt; filter(team_display_name == \"Oklahoma City Thunder\")\nmin &lt;- playoffs |&gt; filter(team_display_name == \"Minnesota Timberwolves\")\nden &lt;- playoffs |&gt; filter(team_display_name == \"Denver Nuggets\")\nlac &lt;- playoffs |&gt; filter(team_display_name == \"LA Clippers\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_step(data=playoffs, aes(x=game_date, y=cumpointdiff, group=team_display_name), color=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_step(data=bos, aes(x=game_date, y=cumpointdiff, group=team_display_name), color=\"#007A33\") +\n  geom_step(data=okc, aes(x=game_date, y=cumpointdiff, group=team_display_name), color=\"#007AC1\") +\n  geom_step(data=min, aes(x=game_date, y=cumpointdiff, group=team_display_name), color=\"#78BE20\") +\n  geom_step(data=den, aes(x=game_date, y=cumpointdiff, group=team_display_name), color=\"#FFC627\") +\n  geom_step(data=lac, aes(x=game_date, y=cumpointdiff, group=team_display_name), color=\"black\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=as.Date(\"2024-02-15\"), y=630, label=\"Celtics\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=as.Date(\"2024-03-21\"), y=572, label=\"Thunder\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=as.Date(\"2024-03-13\"), y=393, label=\"Timberwolves\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=as.Date(\"2024-04-23\"), y=400, label=\"Nuggets\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=as.Date(\"2024-04-20\"), y=310, label=\"Clippers\") +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Date\",\n    y=\"Cumulative Point Differential\",\n    title=\"Youth shines in the Western Conference.\",\n    subtitle=\"The Thunder stand atop the West in point differential despite being the second youngest team in the league.\",\n    caption=\"Source: hoopR | By: Dillon Siders\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cumulative point differential once again shows that the Thunder, Timberwolves, and Nuggets were the top 3 teams in the West. It also showed that the Thunder and Timberwolves slightly edged the Nuggets out once again.\nOn the season the OKC and Minnesota finished with a plus 500 point differential while the Nuggets came in just below that mark. Even though the Nuggets were below the Thunder and Timberwolves they were well ahead of the 4th-seeded Clippers by a couple hundred points.\nWhile point differential is great to measure a team’s consistency it is not the only way to predict playoff success. There are a multitude of metrics one can look at, but two that paint a fairly good picture are a team’s offensive and defensive ratings.\n\n\nCode\nnbateamadvanced &lt;- read_csv(\"nba_advanced_team.csv\") \n\nnbateamadvancedrenamed &lt;- nbateamadvanced |&gt;\n  rename(\n    Rank=...1,\n    Team=...2,\n    Age=...3,\n    Wins=...4,\n    Loses=...5,\n    ExpectedWins=...6,\n    ExpectedLoses=...7,\n    MarginOfVictory=...8,\n    StrengthOfSchedule=...9,\n    SimpleRating=...10,\n    ORating=...11,\n    DRating=...12,\n    NetRating=...13,\n    Pace=...14,\n    FreethrowRate=...15,\n    `3PTRate`=...16,\n    TrueShootingPct=...17,\n    EffectiveFGPct= `Offense Four Factors...19`,\n    TurnoverPct= `Offense Four Factors...20`,\n    OffensiveReboundPct= `Offense Four Factors...21`,\n    FreethrowsPerFGA= `Offense Four Factors...22`,\n    OpponentEffectiveFGPct= `Defense Four Factors...24`,\n    OpponentTurnoverPct= `Defense Four Factors...25`,\n    DefensiveReboundPct= `Defense Four Factors...26`,\n    OpponentFreethrowsPerFGA= `Defense Four Factors...27`,\n    Arena=...29,\n    Attendance=...30,\n    AvgAttendance=...31\n  ) |&gt;\n  filter(Rank != \"Rk\") |&gt;\n  mutate(Team=gsub(\"\\\\*\", \"\", Team)) |&gt; \n  mutate_at(vars(-Team, -Arena), as.numeric) \n\nnbateamadvancedrenamed |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    AvgORating= mean(ORating),\n    AvgDRating= mean(DRating)\n  )\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  AvgORating AvgDRating\n       &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n1       115.       115.\n\n\nCode\nokc &lt;- nbateamadvancedrenamed |&gt; filter(Team == \"Oklahoma City Thunder\")\nden &lt;- nbateamadvancedrenamed |&gt; filter(Team == \"Denver Nuggets\")\nmin &lt;- nbateamadvancedrenamed |&gt; filter(Team == \"Minnesota Timberwolves\")\nlac &lt;- nbateamadvancedrenamed |&gt; filter(Team == \"Los Angeles Clippers\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data=nbateamadvancedrenamed, aes(x=ORating, y=DRating), color=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_point(data=den, aes(x=ORating, y=DRating), color=\"#FFC627\") +\n  geom_point(data=min, aes(x=ORating, y=DRating), color=\"#78BE20\") +\n  geom_point(data=okc, aes(x=ORating, y=DRating), size= 3, color=\"#007AC1\") +\n  geom_point(data=lac, aes(x=ORating, y=DRating), color=\"black\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 115.2567) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 115.2833) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=119.35, y=113.25, label=\"Nuggets\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=119.5, y=111.75, label=\"Thunder\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=119.7, y=115.6, label=\"Clippers\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=117, y=109, label=\"Timberwolves\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=121, y=110, label=\"Good Offense, Good Defense\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=110, y=116, label=\"Bad Offense, Bad Defense\") +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Offensive Efficiency\",\n    y=\"Defensive Efficiency\",\n    title=\"True title contenders are great on both sides of the court.\",\n    subtitle=\"While all the top teams in the west play both ways the Thunder bring the most balance between offense and defense.\",\n    caption=\"Source: https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2024.html | By: Dillon Siders \"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 19, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen comparing offensive and defensive ratings between teams we see OKC, Denver, and Minnesota separate themselves again. Although they separated themselves the Timberwolves did it differently than the Thunder and Nuggets.\nThis year Minnesota had the best defense in the NBA by a fairly large margin. Their defensive identity pairs perfectly with rising superstar Anthony Edwards’ electric offensive game creating the perfect storm. OKC and Denver took slightly different approaches.\nNeither OKC nor Denver can match Minnesota’s defense because they do not have the personnel to do it. Minnesota starts two 7-footers, a 6’10 wing, and brings another big off the bench as their 6th man. OKC and Denver do not possess the same size, but that doesn’t make them much worse at defense.\nWhere OKC and Denver lack on defense they make up for it in offense. While all three teams finished in the top 8 in defensive rating, only OKC and Denver did that for offensive rating, both finishing top 5. Minnesota ended the season ranked 16th on offense.\nThis is again because of team personnel. Minnesota heavily relies on one player to generate most of their offense, that being Anthony Edwards. OKC and Denver can play a more balanced way because they each have multiple great shot-creators and rely more on ball/player movement.\nIn a Western Conference as competitive as this it is hard to predict what will and won’t happen. Those predictions get even harder come playoff time when everything is turned up a level. This is why saying a team like the Thunder can’t compete even though they stack up well against the defending champions and the rest of the conference can be shortsighted."
