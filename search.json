    "text": "2023 was an interesting year for NFL offenses and QBs. After years of consistent improvement in QB play this year was different. This down year at the QB position contributed to one of the weirdest MVP races in recent memory.\nBaltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson ended up winning the 2023 NFL MVP award in a landslide securing 49 of the 50 first-place votes. Jackson was critical to the Ravens’ success this year leading them to a 13-3 record, the best in the NFL, but he lacked some of the other criteria that past MVP had.\nWhile you cannot question Jackson’s impact on the Ravens you can question if he was the “most valuable” player in the NFL. Multiple other QBs put up similar or superior individual stats but fell short in the team success category.\nSo, how do you evaluate which player brings more value than another? That’s the hard part.\nA starting point is evaluating which plays are more valuable than others. Since the revolution of the passing game, passing plays have become more efficient and effective than rushing plays.\nThis can be displayed by the average expected points added per play(EPA/play) for passing and rushing plays. On the season only three teams had a positive EPA/play on rushing plays, the 49ers, Ravens, and Bills. This means on average only the 49ers, Ravens, and Bills increase their odds of scoring when they run the ball.\nNow that we know what play type brings more value we can dive into the numbers and we’ll see which MVP candidates brought the most value.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggtext)\n\nqb_raw_stats &lt;- read_csv(\"qbrawstats.csv\") |&gt;\n  mutate(Player=gsub(\"\\\\*\",\"\",Player)) |&gt;\n  mutate(Player=gsub(\"\\\\+\",\"\",Player))\n\nmvps &lt;- c(\"Dak Prescott\", \"Lamar Jackson\", \"Josh Allen\", \"Brock Purdy\")\n\nmvp &lt;- qb_raw_stats |&gt;

Dak Prescott dominated basic throwing stats. Not only did he lead in total passing volume(completions and attempts) but he posted some of the best efficiency numbers(completion%, touchdown%, and interception%)\nOn the other hand, Jackson and Purdy were both outside the top 15 in total volume. Can someone be the most valuable player if they rank in the lower half for the most valuable type of play? For QBs like Jackson who provide elite scrambling ability, yes. For QBs like Purdy who are primarily pocket passers, no.\n\n\nCode\nqb_airyards_yac &lt;- read_csv(\"qbs_airyards_yac.csv\") |&gt;\n  mutate(Player=gsub(\"\\\\*\",\"\",Player)) |&gt;\n  mutate(Player=gsub(\"\\\\+\",\"\",Player))\n\nmvps &lt;- c(\"Dak Prescott\", \"Lamar Jackson\", \"Josh Allen\", \"Brock Purdy\")\n\nmvp_airyards_yac &lt;- qb_airyards_yac |&gt;\n  filter(Player %in% mvps) |&gt;\n  select(Player, CAY, `CAY/Cmp`, `CAY/PA`, YAC, `YAC/Cmp`)\n\nmvp_airyards_yac |&gt;\n  gt() |&gt;\n  cols_label(\n    CAY = \"Completed Air Yards\",\n    `CAY/Cmp`= \"Completed Air Yards Per Completion\",\n    `CAY/PA`= \"Completed Air Yards Per Pass\",\n    YAC = \"Yards After Catch\",\n    `YAC/Cmp`= \"Yards After Catch Per Completion\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"In a league becoming more and more pass happy not all passing yards are similar.\",\n    subtitle = \"Which candidates get their yards through the air compared to teammates getting them after the catch.\"\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")) |&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Dillon Siders  |  **Source:** https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2023/passing_advanced.htm#\")) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12))) |&gt;\n  opt_row_striping() |&gt; \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\")  |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"green\", weight = \"bold\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(CAY),\n      rows = CAY == 2553)) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"red\", weight = \"bold\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(CAY),\n      rows = CAY == 1926)) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"green\", weight = \"bold\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(`CAY/Cmp`),\n      rows = `CAY/Cmp` == 7.2)) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"red\", weight = \"bold\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(`CAY/Cmp`),\n      rows = `CAY/Cmp` == 6.1)) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"green\", weight = \"bold\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(`CAY/PA`),\n      rows = `CAY/PA` == 5.0)) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"red\", weight = \"bold\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(`CAY/PA`),\n      rows = `CAY/PA` == 4.0)) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"green\", weight = \"bold\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(YAC),\n      rows = YAC == 1752)) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"red\", weight = \"bold\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(YAC),\n      rows = YAC == 2054)) |&gt;\n   tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"green\", weight = \"bold\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(`YAC/Cmp`),\n      rows = `YAC/Cmp` == 4.8)) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"red\", weight = \"bold\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(`YAC/Cmp`),\n      rows = `YAC/Cmp` == 6.7)) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"purple\", weight = \"bold\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(Player),\n      rows = Player == \"Lamar Jackson\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a league becoming more and more pass happy not all passing yards are similar.\n\n\nWhich candidates get their yards through the air compared to teammates getting them after the catch.\n\n\nPlayer\nCompleted Air Yards\nCompleted Air Yards Per Completion\nCompleted Air Yards Per Pass\nYards After Catch\nYards After Catch Per Completion\n\n\n\n\nDak Prescott\n2553\n6.2\n4.3\n1963\n4.8\n\n\nJosh Allen\n2337\n6.1\n4.0\n1969\n5.1\n\n\nBrock Purdy\n2226\n7.2\n5.0\n2054\n6.7\n\n\nLamar Jackson\n1926\n6.3\n4.2\n1752\n5.7\n\n\n\nBy: Dillon Siders | Source: https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2023/passing_advanced.htm#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen looking at how good of a passer a QB is base stats are not the only thing you want to look at because they do not tell the entire story. For this, we have other metrics like completed air yards(CAY) and yards after catch(YAC). These help show how much assistance a quarterback gets in gaining their yards.\nHere we see Dak Prescott make his case for best QB through the air in 2023 leading candidates in CAY while getting the least help per reception through YAC. On the flip side, Brock Purdy is the only candidate with 2000 plus YAC on the year.\nThese differences can be caused by lots of things, but the most common ones are offensive scheming and skill position talent. Take the 49ers for example. Their offense is designed around getting their skills players room to generate YAC. Pair that with elite YAC weapons like Christian McCaffrey, Deebo Samuel, Brandon Aiyuk, and George Kittle you have the recipe for easy yardage. The Ravens are somewhat similar to the 49ers on offense just without all the elite talent around the QB.\nPrescott and Allen aren’t as fortunate. Whether it be offensive scheming or subpar weapons these QBs cannot rely on YAC like the other two.\nThe most important part of playing QB has to be accuracy. How can an offense function at full force with a signal caller who constantly misses open receivers or throws it to the defense?\n\n\nCode\nqb_advanced_accuracy &lt;- read_csv(\"qbs_advanced_accuracy.csv\") |&gt; \n  mutate(Player=gsub(\"\\\\*\",\"\",Player)) |&gt;\n  mutate(Player=gsub(\"\\\\+\",\"\",Player)) |&gt; \n  mutate(`Drop%`=gsub(\"%\",\"\",`Drop%`)) |&gt; \n  mutate(`Bad%`=gsub(\"%\",\"\",`Bad%`)) |&gt; \n  mutate(`OnTgt%`=gsub(\"%\",\"\",`OnTgt%`)) |&gt; \n  mutate(`OnTgt%` = as.numeric(`OnTgt%`)) |&gt; \n  mutate(`Bad%` = as.numeric(`Bad%`))\n\nmvps &lt;- c(\"Dak Prescott\", \"Lamar Jackson\", \"Josh Allen\", \"Brock Purdy\")\n\nmvp_accuracy &lt;- qb_advanced_accuracy |&gt;\n  filter(Player %in% mvps) |&gt;\n  select(Player, Drops, `Drop%`, BadTh, `Bad%`, OnTgt, `OnTgt%`)\n\nmvp_accuracy |&gt;\n  gt() |&gt;\n  cols_label(\n    BadTh = \"Bad Throws\",\n    `Bad%`= \"Bad Throw%\",\n    OnTgt = \"On Target Throws\",\n    `OnTgt%` = \"On Target Throw%\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Grading QB accuracy goes far beyond completion percentage and interceptions.\",\n    subtitle = \"Which MVP candidates truly kept the ball on target and out of harms way.\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Dillon Siders  |  **Source:** https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2023/passing_advanced.htm#\")) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12))) |&gt;\n  opt_row_striping() |&gt; \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\") |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"green\", weight = \"bold\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(Drops),\n      rows = Drops == 9)) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"red\", weight = \"bold\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(Drops),\n      rows = Drops == 38)) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"green\", weight = \"bold\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(BadTh),\n      rows = BadTh == 68)) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"red\", weight = \"bold\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(BadTh),\n      rows = BadTh == 78)) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"green\", weight = \"bold\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(`Drop%`),\n      rows = `Drop%` &lt; 2.11)) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"red\", weight = \"bold\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(`Drop%`),\n      rows = `Drop%` &gt; 6.59)) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"green\", weight = \"bold\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(`Bad%`),\n      rows = `Bad%` == 11.7)) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"red\", weight = \"bold\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(`Bad%`),\n      rows = `Bad%` == 16.6)) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"green\", weight = \"bold\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(OnTgt),\n      rows = OnTgt == 479)) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"red\", weight = \"bold\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(OnTgt),\n      rows = OnTgt == 324)) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"green\", weight = \"bold\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(`OnTgt%`),\n      rows = `OnTgt%` == 82.6)) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"red\", weight = \"bold\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(`OnTgt%`),\n      rows = `OnTgt%` == 73.9)) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"purple\", weight = \"bold\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(Player),\n      rows = Player == \"Lamar Jackson\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrading QB accuracy goes far beyond completion percentage and interceptions.\n\n\nWhich MVP candidates truly kept the ball on target and out of harms way.\n\n\nPlayer\nDrops\nDrop%\nBad Throws\nBad Throw%\nOn Target Throws\nOn Target Throw%\n\n\n\n\nDak Prescott\n38\n6.60\n68\n11.7\n479\n82.6\n\n\nJosh Allen\n31\n5.60\n78\n14.2\n427\n77.8\n\n\nBrock Purdy\n9\n2.10\n70\n16.3\n324\n75.5\n\n\nLamar Jackson\n22\n5.00\n73\n16.6\n326\n73.9\n\n\n\nBy: Dillon Siders | Source: https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2023/passing_advanced.htm#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccuracy is not just a player’s completion percentage. There a plenty of outside factors that can worsen a QBs completion percentage that are uncontrollable like drops, throwaways, and spikes. Stats like bad throw percentage(BT%) and on-target throw percentage(OnTgt%) can show you true accuracy taking uncontrolables into account.\nSurprise, Surprise once again Dak Prescott outclasses his competition. In all seriousness Dak Prescott not only was the most accurate QB in 2023, but he also kept the ball out of harm’s way better than anyone else ranking second in BT% and first in OnTgt% for the 2023 season. Josh Allen was the only comparable candidate in these stats ranking 7th in BT% and 10th in OnTgt%.\nIn comparison, the MVP had the worst BT% and OnTgt% of all the candidates. Jackson ranked outside the top 20 in both of these categories. Purdy wasn’t much better than Jackson here ranking 21st in BT% and 17th in OnTgt% for 2023.\nWhile basic stats, air yards, YAC, and advanced accuracy are great starting points there is a better way to evaluate QB thanks to the modern, analytics-based league. For this, we use the holy stat of NFL debate EPA/play.\n\n\nCode\nmvp_weekley_epa_advanced &lt;- read_csv(\"MVP_weekly_epa_advanced.csv\") |&gt;\n  mutate(`Success rate`=gsub(\"%\",\"\",`Success rate`)) |&gt; \n  mutate(`Success rate` = as.numeric(`Success rate`))\n\ndak &lt;- mvp_weekley_epa_advanced |&gt; filter(Player == \"Dak Prescott\")\nlamar &lt;- mvp_weekley_epa_advanced |&gt; filter(Player == \"Lamar Jackson\")\njosh &lt;- mvp_weekley_epa_advanced |&gt; filter(Player == \"Josh Allen\")\nbrock &lt;- mvp_weekley_epa_advanced |&gt; filter(Player == \"Brock Purdy\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_line(data=mvp_weekley_epa_advanced, aes(x=Week, y=`EPA/play`, color=Player), alpha=.4) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.057, alpha = .6) +\n  geom_point(data= dak, aes(x=Week, y=`EPA/play`), color=\"navy\", alpha=.4) +\n  geom_point(data= lamar, aes(x=Week, y=`EPA/play`), color=\"purple\") +\n  geom_point(data= josh, aes(x=Week, y=`EPA/play`), color=\"blue\", alpha=.3) +\n  geom_point(data= brock, aes(x=Week, y=`EPA/play`), color=\"red\", alpha=.3) + \n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18)) +\n  scale_color_manual(values=c(\"red\", \"navy\", \"blue\", \"purple\")) +\n  labs(\n    x= \"Week\",\n    y= \"Expected Points Added Per Play\",\n    title = \"Did Lamar Jackson truly dominate competition on a\\ndown to down basis this year?\",\n    subtitle = \"While Lamar played well other QB were just as good if not better over the entire season.\",\n    caption = \"Source: https://rbsdm.com/stats/stats/ | By: Dillon Siders\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEPA/play or expected points added per play is an advanced stat that evaluates a player’s down-to-down efficiency while factoring down, distance, and situation. This is calculated by taking the difference between expected points before the play and expected points after it’s over.\nThis is important for the MVP race because EPA/play has been crucial to predicting the MVP. The last time a QB won the MVP award and was not the league leader in EPA/play was in 2015 when Cam Newton won it for the Panthers.\nIn 2023, the EPA/play leader on the season was Brock Purdy, followed by Dak Prescott in 2nd, and Josh Allen in 3rd. If they rounded off the top 3 Lamar had to be 4th right? Wrong, Jackson came in at 8th behind Kirk Cousins(6th) and Jalen Hurts(7th).\nOver the course of the entire season, Lamar Jackson was not even the most efficient player at his position let alone in the entire NFL. According to EPA/play it seems like Jackson’s MVP campaign was built on a blowout win against the 49ers in week 16 where he was slightly above average and the demolition against the Dolphins the next week where he was otherworldly.\nWhile EPA/play by itself is a great measure when you combine it with others it paints an even clearer picture. When paired together EPA/play and completion percentage over expected(CPOE) can show you a quarterback’s down-to-down efficiency and accuracy.\n\n\nCode\nall_qb_season &lt;- read_csv(\"all_qb_season_epa_advanced.csv\") |&gt; \n  mutate(`Success rate`=gsub(\"%\",\"\",`Success rate`)) |&gt; \n  mutate(`Success rate` = as.numeric(`Success rate`))\n\ndak_epa &lt;- all_qb_season |&gt; filter(Player == \"D.Prescott\")\nlamar_epa &lt;- all_qb_season |&gt; filter(Player == \"L.Jackson\")\njosh_epa &lt;- all_qb_season |&gt; filter(Player == \"J.Allen\")\nbrock_epa &lt;- all_qb_season |&gt; filter(Player == \"B.Purdy\")\n\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data=all_qb_season, aes(x=`EPA+CPOE composite`, y=`Success rate`), color=\"grey\") +\n  geom_point(data=dak_epa, aes(x=`EPA+CPOE composite`, y=`Success rate`), color=\"navy\") +\n  geom_point(data=lamar_epa, aes(x=`EPA+CPOE composite`, y=`Success rate`), color=\"purple\", size=3) +\n  geom_point(data=josh_epa, aes(x=`EPA+CPOE composite`, y=`Success rate`), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_point(data=brock_epa, aes(x=`EPA+CPOE composite`, y=`Success rate`), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 46.59333) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 0.08086667) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=0.195, y=55.5, label=\"Brock Purdy\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=0.175, y=51.5, label=\"Dak Prescott\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=0.14, y=53, label=\"Josh Allen\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=0.10, y=50.85, label=\"Lamar Jackson\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=0.125, y=57, label=\"Efficient and Accurate\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=0.04, y=38, label=\"Inefficient and Inaccurate\") +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Down to Down Efficiency and Accuracy\",\n    y=\"Success Rate\",\n    title= \"As teams look to become more efficient on both sides \\nof the ball, one QB(or coach) might have found the \\nblueprint for sustained success.\",\n    subtitle= \"While all 4 candidates rank at the top of Success Rate, Brock Purdy and Dak Prescott separate themselves from \\nthe competition with down to down accuracy and efficiency.

Success rate is defined as the percentage of plays where EPA is greater than 0. In other words, did the QB keep the offense moving and create productive plays.\nLooking at the entire NFL it’s obvious that these four QBs were the right candidates for MVP. All four of them rank 1-4 in Success Rate. Where they separate themselves is efficiency and accuracy. Purdy blew every other QB out of the water. Prescott separated himself from 3rd and Purdy was still way ahead of him.\nJackson still ranked inside the top 7 in terms of EPA/play and CPOE, but he was worse than the other three candidates. While that is very good, even great it is not MVP level."

    "title": "Mock Draft with Trades",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Draft night is only 2 weeks away. As the draft hastily approaches fans and scouts alike are patiently awaiting which players end up on their teams. All the commotion has flooded the internet with loads of draft content from lots of different creators. To make this mock a little more unique I decided to include some trades.\nMaking a mock draft with trades can be difficult because you do not know what teams value more than others. Because of this I decided to make most of the trades centered around draft capital instead of players. I did include one player deal because I think the move makes a lot of sense for both teams. Finally I wanted to make the trades fun, somewhat realistic, and prospect focused. With that said lets get into the mock.\nNo.1 Atlanta Hawks: Alex Sarr\nAlex Sarr is the right pick at No.1 no matter what is in the plans for Atlanta’s future. If Trae Young and Dejounte Murray are still there in the fall Sarr looks to be the perfect mobile, rim-protecting, lob threat to fit next to them. If they move on from those two Sarr is put in the position to have the freedom to experiment and develop his offensive game and become a 2-way star.\nNo.2 Washington Wizards: Donovan Clingan\nWhile Zaccharie Riasher is the favorite to be selected after Alex Sarr I have the Wizards taking a different route. Trading Daniel Gafford at the deadline last season left the Wizards frontcourt without a rim protector. Adding Donovan Clingan fills that hole with the potential to be much more. Pairing Clingan’s rim protection with Bilai Coulibaly and Deni Avdija could turn into one of the better defensive frontcourts in a few years.\nNo.3 Detroit Pistons: Zaccharie Risacher\nThe first trade that I have in this mock is the Pistons pouncing on Zaccharie Risacher’s slight fall. Detroit is in desperate need of some floor spacing next to rising star Cade Cunningham and Risasher provides just that. He also has some interesting defensive potential both on and off the ball. Risacher gives Detroit the archetype of player they are looking for with the potential to become more in the future.\nNo.4 San Antonio Spurs: Stephon Castle\nAt 4 I have the Spurs taking UConn combo guard Stephon Castle. During the draft process, Castle and his camp have made it known that he wants a chance to play point guard in the NBA. Landing in San Antonio gives Castle that chance since Tre Jones is the current starter. Even if Castle ends up not being able to play the point he can slide over to the wing and fill a similar role to the one he played this year at UConn. Whether on or off ball Castle will bring great playmaking and defense to complement rising star Victor Wembanyama.\nNo.5 Houston Rockets: Rob Dillingham\nAfter trading back to 5 and adding some future assets the Rockets add some depth in their backcourt with Rob Dillingham. The small, skinny, and shifty guard brings the Rockets a punch of shot creation, shooting, and playmaking they need off the bench. Early on Dillingham can play a similar role to the one he played at Kentucky as a bench microwave scorer and playmaker. If all goes well Dillingham will take over for Fred VanVleet after his contract is up in 2 years and form a dynamic backcourt with Jalen Green.\nNo.6 Charlotte Hornets: Reed Sheppard\nReed Sheppard landing in Charlotte pairs one of my favorite players in the draft with one of their better fits. I think going to a situation where he can play next to other on-ball creators like Lamelo Ball and Brandon Miller will let Sheppard make a smooth transition to the league. Reed profiles as the perfect complementary guard with elite shooting numbers and secondary playmaking skills. Playing next to Lamelo will let Sheppard fully commit to this role while he continues to develop shot-creation skills.\nNo.7 Portland Trail Blazers: Ron Holland\nSo far during their rebuild Portland has already added the player they hope to be the face of their franchise in Scoot Henderson. At 7 they can go a lot of different directions but I have them swinging on Ignite wing Ron Holland. Portland already has a few interesting young wings but none of them offer the same offensive upside Holland can. Even though Holland can’t space the floor yet, his athleticism lets him feast in transition and as a driver. His athleticism also transfers to the defensive end where he makes some jaw-dropping plays. His all-around consistency needs to improve, but Holland will have plenty of time and opportunity to grow while the Trail Blazers work through the rebuild.\nNo.8 San Antonio Spurs: Devin Carter\nThe Spurs are back on the clock and they add more stability to their backcourt with Providence guard Devin Carter. I know what some might be thinking, you took Stephon Castle at 4 to be the point guard why take Carter now? First, NBA positions are becoming less and less important. Look at the finals, neither team has a traditional point guard that runs all the offense. A Castle and Carter backcourt would allow both to split ball-handling duties while focusing on the complementary skills that make them great players. Also, the Spurs already have Victor Wembanyama and Devin Vassell who both should see the majority of touches. Second, in the scenario, the Castle can’t play point guard you can slide him over to the wing and let Carter play there. No matter what position Carter brings hard-nosed point-of-attack defense, secondary playmaking, and improved outside shooting that perfectly complements the rising stars on the roster.\nNo.9 Oklahoma City Thunder: Dalton Knecht\nThe second trade of this mock involves the Thunder opening up the vault and spending some of their draft capital to get Dalton Knecht. The Tennesee wing is an absolute flamethrowing from deep. Outside of his shooting, Knecht provides a 3-level scoring impact with some impressive shot-making skills. Knecht still has questions on defense, but he showed great effort and made improvements throughout the season. In these playoffs we saw the impact an elite shooter like Isaiah Joe made, eventually getting him a starting role. I think that Knecht can bring the same value as Isaiah Joe with the upside to become a lot more thanks to his better size and strength. Joe is likely in for a massive payday and if the Thunder choose to let him walk Knecht could be the perfect replacement.\nNo.10 Utah Jazz: Cody Williams\nCollin Sexton and Keyonte George emerged as bright spots on this young Jazz roster next to Lauri Marrkkanen, but they did not get much production from their wings. To fix that they select Cody Williams from Colorado. Williams had an up-and-down season riddled by injuries but when he was healthy he flashed tremendous upside. He exhibited great finishing and defensive versatility that can be taken to the next level when his frame fills out. He also flashed potential as a shooter making over 40% of his threes, but only on 41 total attempts. If Williams can tighten his handle, shot a respectable percentage from three, and fill out his frame he’ll be one of the more valuable two-way wings in the NBA. Even if he doesn’t hit his ceiling Williams can provide play finishing, rim pressure, and defense next to their other core players.\nNo.11 Chicago Bulls: Matas Buzelis\nChicago brings Matas Buzelis back to his hometown where he can hopefully turn help turn the Bulls around. Having been stuck in mediocrity for the past few seasons Chicago needs to choose a direction. Drafting Buzelis can help them make that decision since he will need some time before positively contribuiting to a team. Buzelis has a intriguing upside tied to his athleticism, height, and handle. Even with those Buzelis still has questions mostly around his scoring and playmaking. He showed flashes on these areas, but without consistent ways to score or set others up Buzelis could struggle to find a defined role. Selecting Buzelis should be paired with moving on from older players like DeMar DeRozan to bring in as much draft capital as possible to kick off a rebuild.\nNo.12 Memphis Grizzlies: Tristan Da Silva\nTrading down with the Thunder results in the Grizzlies selecting the other Colorado wing Tristan Da Silva. Memphis has long been looking for a bigger wing to fit next to Ja Morant, Desmond Bane, and Jaren Jackson. While Da Silva isn’t the classic 3-and-D roll player type he is a dribble-pass-shooter player. That overall offensive versatility lets him play multiple roles and fit next to lots of different players. Even though Da Silva isn’t a lockdown defender he won’t actively hurt your defense either.\nNo.13 Washington Wizards: Nikola Topic\nWashington ends the slide of Nikola Topic by trading up with the Sacramento Kings. This deal involves Kyle Kuzma being sent to Sacramento for the 13th pick, salary filler, and maybe another pick. In recent weeks it has been revealed that Topic suffered a partially torn ACL. Here we play out the scenario that this results in him falling to the later lottery. With proper management and rest I do not expect this injury to be a major issue. Washington has been lacking a true playmaking lead guard that can give their offense some much-needed stability. Pairing Topic with the No.2 overall pick Donovan Clingan is a match made in heaven. Topic and Clingan have the potential to be a deadly pick-and-roll duo on offense, and Clingan’s rim protection can erase some of the mistakes Topic will inevitably make on the perimeter.\nNo.14 Orlando Magic: Bub Carrington\nTrade number 3 has the Magic trading up to take guard Bub Carrington. Orlando has lacked offensive production from this backcourt and drafting Carrington is an attempt to fix that. Carrington likely won’t contribute in year 1, but with a little development, they could acquire a deadly offensive weapon. The intrigue in Carrington comes from his shot creation and playmaking abilities as one of the youngest players in the class. His three-point numbers do not look the greatest, but they do not paint the entire picture. Carrington’s shot diet was heavily based on off-the-dribble jump shots from both 3 and mid-range. In the mid-range, he shot 50% on over 125 total attempts gives me hope in him pushing that out to 3 eventually. A fully evolved Carrington would have the versatility to space the floor for Paolo Banchero and Franz Wagner or set both of them up with his passing.\nNo.15 Miami Heat: Isaiah Collier\nAt 15 I have the Miami Heat planning for their future by taking high upside point guard Isaiah Collier. While at USC Collier flashed his amazing potential as a lead initiator and downhill driver, but ultimately had some inconsistencies that NBA teams might be worried about. Collier currently does not pose much of a threat as a jump shooter from either mid-range of three and had some turnover problems early in the season. Collier is the front runner to be the Tyrese Mexey of this class in the sense that he could slide out of the lottery on draft night. A team like Miami who has a solidified core, but still lacks offensive firepower can invest in his advantage creation and wiat a couple years for him to hit his stride.\nNo.16 Philadelphia 76ers: Tyler Smith\nPhiladelphia left themselves with a lot of work this offseason. Tons of their roster is set to enter free agency they can take this pick in any direction. I decided to swing for upside while finding someone that can fit next to stars like Joel Embiid and Tyrese Maxey. The fully realized version of Tyler Smith fits that role perfectly. Smith is a 6’10 stretch 4 with tons of athletic ability. His floor spacing is perfect for giving Embiid and Maxey room to operate on offense.\nNo.17 Los Angeles Lakers: Jared McCain\nOne thing a team like the Lakers can’t get enough of is shooting. Adding Jared McCain gives them a great shooter with lots of room to grow on offense. Along with his shooting McCain showed solid skills as a passer, but he struggled to generator rim pressure consistently. He also lacks traditional size for a off guard some development of on-ball skills will be key. On defense McCain has some questions mainly pretaining to his size and athleticism. Finally McCain gives the Lakers flexibility to move on from D’Angelo Russell this offseason if they feel like it.\nNo.18 Portland Trail Blazers: Tidjane Salaun\nTrading down with Orlando was a great move for a team like Portland that wants to emass tons of draft capital. Even with the move down Portland can still select a player I believe would be in play for them at 14, that being Tidjane Salaun. Salaun has been one of the most polarizing prospects in this class. NBA teams have apparently been enamored with Salaun. Salaun still a major project and is likely a few years away from contributing positively. Luckily Portland has the time and patience to wait on this. At his ceiling Salaun can provide a Michael Porter Jr type impact, but at his floor Salaun likely wouldn’t consistently be in a NBA rotation.\nNo.19 Toronto Raptors: Ja’Kobe Walter\nThe Raptors are set to make their first pick at 19th after their own first dropped to 8 and conveyed to San Antonio. Even without a top 10 pick the Raptors take someone who was projected to go there at the start of the cycle Ja’Kobe Walter. Walter slipped some in the draft after he wasn’t the 2-way player many thought he would be at Baylor. In the past Toronto has loved to take lengthy and theoretically versatile players and Walter fits that to a tee. His biggest basketball strength is his shooting which should fit perfect next to Scottie Barnes and Immanuel Quickley. Walter gives Toronto a do over on finding the perfect complementary shooter.\nNo.20 Cleveland Cavaliers: Jaylon Tyson\nCleveland could make major waves that shake up the draft and the entire offseason. After losing to the Celtics there have been questions on Jarrett Allen and Darius Garland and their future with the team. If I had to guess who gets moved I’d go with Allen, but I won’t be doing that in this mock. Instead I just have them taking Jaylon Tyson. The Cavs have long been looking for consistent wing play next to their four core players. Tyson gives a extra boost in almost every facet of offense. He also showed good ability as a ball handler that only Caris Levert rivals in the wing room.\nNo.21 New Orleans Pelicans: Daron Holmes\nIt is likely that Jonas Valanciunas has played his last game for the Pelicans. After getting swept by the Thunder it was rumored that the Pelicans could look to make some major roster changes. Getting a big man like Daron Holmes who has the potential to space the floor would open up lanes for Zion Williamson. Outside of shooting, Holmes is best used as a play finisher and rim protector. What most do not see is some of the untapped things with Holmes. With Dayton he showed flashes of face-up offense, some handle, and playmaking. If New Orleans can tap into these, Holmes could become the perfect big next to Zion\nNo.22 Phoenix Suns: Yves Missi\nI fully expect whoever the Suns take to be traded if the pick isn’t trade before draft night. I ended up selecting Yves Missi because he has some of the same traits as a Dereck Lively type big. We have seen in the playoffs how valuable Lively’s skillset has been for Dallas. While I do not think Missi is as refined as Lively was he possesses similar athletic traits. Missi doesn’t have the same upside since he doesn’t process the game as good as Lively, but if you told me they ended up playing similar roles in the NBA I wouldn’t be shocked.\nNo.23 Milwaukee Bucks: Tyler Kolek\nMilwaukee had a disappointing playoffs, mostly to do with Giannis and Damian Lillard being injured. Outside of Lillard the Bucks lacked a real point guard to keep things calm. Drafting Tyler Kolek can give the Bucks the back up point guard and bench shooting they desperatly need. I can see Kolek being a contributor frm day one as the backup floor general similar to a Tj McConnell or Tyus Jones.\nNo.24 New York Knicks: Zach Edey\nNew York has two picks back to back. It is very likely that one of those is traded and moved into the future. I have them sticking and picking at 24 with the selection being Zach Edey. This offseason New York has two heavily coveted free agents, those being OG Anunoby and Isaiah Hartenstein. They should be able to bring both back but in the scenario they can only sign one I’d expect them to proiritize Anunoby. While Edey doesn’t fit Hartenstein’s role perfectly he can come in fill some of it. On offense his biggest use is as a screen setter and roll finisher which works great with Jalen Brunson. On defense he can play deep drop and protect the rim while New Yorks perimeter defenders funnel ball handlers into him.\nNo.25 Utah Jazz: Kyshawn George\nThe second to last trade in this mock involves the Jazz moving future picks to jump the Wizards. Here they add a offensively skilled wing out of Miami, Kyshawn George. George is one of those late growth spur wings who kept their guard skills. I like his handle and shooting for this size, but ahtletic concerns keep me from moving George much higher. Despite being 6’8 George doesn’t put tons of pressure on the rim because of his poor acceleration. He made up for this with flashes of incredible shot making off the catch and dribble.\nNo.26 Washington Wizards: Kyle Filipowski\nSomeone that ended up falling is Duke big Kyle Filipowski. I’m lower on him then consensus, but even I would take him higher than this. I think that he brings some good things like his passing and all around perimeter skills for a big man, but without a defensive calling card its hard to project his impact. Filipowski’s wingspan, standing reach, and vertical athleticism are all poor indicators for defensive impact as a rim protector. Where I do think he can make some noise on defense is his switchability. While I wouldn’t call him an ideal switch big he showed major improvments in his lateral mobility from freshman to sophomore year. Earlier I touched on how empty the Wizards big man room is so doubling down on a big who provides different things from Clingan can help Washington’s overall versatility.\nNo.27 Minnesota Timberwolves: Baylor Scheierman\nWhile I’m sure Timberwolves fans are still sad about the loss in the Western Conference Finals this season was an astounding success. Anthony Edwards has emerged as a certified superstar and Minnesota’s defense was best in the league all year. Now I think their next step is finding more role players that fit next to Edwards. Baylor Scheierman should be able to come in showcase his dribble-pass-shoot skillset playing off Minnesota’s stars. Outside of Jaden McDaniels Minnesota lacks real wing depth and shooting which Scheierman provides.\nNo.28 Denver Nuggets: Kevin McCullar\nDenver fell short in there quest to repeat and some of their weaknesses were exposed by the Timberwolves. Pick at 28 likely solve any of those issues, but they can continue to add talented role players to replenish ones that secure paydays. I have them selecting Kanas wing Kevin McCullar to be a do it all wing who focuses on defense. Offense was the main question surround him, but he made big strides on that front this year. The jump shot is still inconsistent, but his connective playmaking and off-ball IQ should let him make an impact outside of his defense.\nNo.29 Brooklyn Nets: Ajay Mitchell\nWith the rise to stardom Jalen Brunson has seen many are trying to find the next Jalen Brunson. While I doubt he gets to that level the player in this class who reminds me the most of Brunson is Ajay Mitchell. He displayed great poise as a driver and used fun, creative footwork to get to his spots. This year Mitchell showcased true 3-level scoring ability, but this was the first year he shot the 3 relativly well. I had the Nets trading into the first to take Mitchell, mostly because I wanted to make a pick for the Nets. Currently the guard rotation in Brooklyn is devoid of much talent, and I think Mitchell can make a impact for them sooner rather than later.\nNo.30 Boston Celtics: Kel’el Ware\nMy though process behind taking Kel’el Ware for the Celtics has been their team building philosophy. We have seen them embrace the three ball and a 5-out style of play. For this play style floor spacing bigs like Kristaps Porzingis and Al Horford a key to success. Ware has the potential to be this type of big man. With Horford’s age only increasing it would be smart of the Celtics to try and replace him in some way. Ware also has great defensive potential based on his athleticism and frame. It is likely that Ware will need a season or two to get a better understanding of the technical sides of basketball. If Ware is able to reach his ceiling it will being tremendous value for the Celtics and make every other franchise even more fearful of them."

    "title": "2024 NBA Draft Prospect Profile: Nikola Topic",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In recent years we have seen an influx of foreign talent enter the NBA. Some of the best players in the league like Giannis Antetekounmpo, Joel Embiid, and Luka Doncic hail from outside the US. While not every country is producing tons of basketball talent some like France have produced tons of NBA players over the last few years.\nAnother country like France that has seen an increase in NBA success among their players is Serbia. Not only is Serbia the home of the current best player in the world Nikola Jokic, but also other NBA role players like Bogdan Bogdanovic and Nikola Jovic. This summer Nikola Topic looks to become the newest Serbian to make his mark in the NBA.\nNikola Topic has been a top prospect in the 2024 draft since the start of the cycle. The 6’6 point guard provides a lot of the things NBA front offices covet in a lead initiator especially since he won’t turn 19 until after the draft. Topic had an up-and-down year showcasing his on-ball potential at Mega before getting called back to Red Star where a couple of injuries derailed the end of his season. Topic’s combination of skills gives him the potential to return top-5 value to a team that drafts him provided they properly manage his development.\nScoring/Shooting\nRight now Nikola Topic’s scoring is predicated on his driving ability. This year playing with Mega, Topic lived in the paint. He is able to pressure the rim without traditional athleticism instead using his IQ, pace, and craft. He can use creative finishing angles and good body control to counter rim protectors. Topic also has great command of the pick and roll and is great at using it to get downhill. It should be noted that Topic is exclusively finishing below the rim and his underwhelming athleticism could cause struggles early on in the NBA.\nOutside of Topic’s finishing, he does not have another area where he can consistently generate offense. His questionable jump shot will allow teams to sag off and go under screens early. Not having a reliable jump shot also limits the impact Topic has off-ball. There are some positive indicators that his jump shot will improve like all-around good touch and a high free throw percentage, but his shooting form has left some questions.\nWhile I do not think that Topic has an ugly jumper by any means there are some improvements he could make. The biggest one for me is the arc on his shots. It was easy to tell the makes from the misses just by the arc alone. When Topic got air under the ball his jumper looked normal, but most of the time his shots were closer to a line drive than a pop fly. Even without a consistent 3-point shot, I can still see Topic becoming an impactful NBA player, but without some way to keep the defense honest there could be a major cap on his ceiling.\nPassing/Playmaking\nThe area where evaluators are most impressed by Topic is his passing. While at Mega he starred as their primary ball handler and offensive initiator. His elite vision and quick decision-making perfectly complement his skills as a driver, finisher, and pick-and-roll ball handler. Topic best displays this when he’s able to use his gravity as a driver to draw in defenders before dishing to an open shooter or big.\nFew in the class rival Topic’s vision, but nobody can match his passing versatility. In my opinion, Topic is the best passer/playmaker in this class because of the sheer amount of passes he can make and his current age. It is rare to see players have the amount of playmaking skill Topic has at his age. He finds teammates in transition, spotting up, rolling to the rim, and along the baseline/in the dunker spot.\nThe final thing that makes Topic a great playmaker is his natural basketball feel. When Topic has the ball in his hands it feels like has absolute command of the offense. It feels like he knows what a defense is going to do before they do it. His high understanding of how defenses react and live dribble passing skills let him make passes other players do not even dream of attempting.\nDefense\nEven though I am a big believer in Nikola Topic’s offensive game his defense leaves me with a lot of questions. Right away Topic is a subpar athlete with a negative wingspan which immediately limits his defensive upside. His athletic limitations mostly hurt him as an on-ball defender. Poor lateral agility and technique make it unlikely Topic ever guards on ball and poor measurables make off-ball impact questionable at best.\nOver the year Topic registered a 1.8 steal% and 0.5 block% which are underwhelming, but the sell on Topic has always been his offense anyway. I definitely think there are paths for Topic to survive on defense off the ball. His high basketball IQ and feel should eventually allow Topic to make an impact off the ball as long as he maintains proper positioning. Teams can also make his life easier on defense by surrounding him with plus defenders.\nOverall Outlook\nThere has been some unfortunate news around Topic as of late that might affect his stock on draft night. Recently it was revealed that Topic suffered a partially torn ACL at the international combine in Treviso Italy. On top of this Topic had another knee injury earlier this year. It has been stated that this should not cause his draft stock to drop, but the NBA is crazy, especially around draft time. As long as the team that selects Topic gives him proper treatment and rest he should be able to debut sometime this upcoming season. Even if he doesn’t play next year we have seen rookies sit out their first year and still become great NBA players.\nAt the start of this draft cycle Topic was as high as my No.1 player in the draft. Though I have cooled some on Topic I still have him as a top-10 player in this year’s class. I would be willing to bet on his passing/playmaking skills, natural basketball IQ, and feel for the game especially since he won’t turn 19 until after draft night.\nIn the NBA I can see two paths that Topic’s career can take. Obviously, there are other outcomes besides the ones I see, but those paths are less clear than the ones I’m mentioning. The first is his high-end outcome where he is a team’s lead guard and initiator. In this role, he would be a high-volume pick-and-roll ball handler who uses his IQ and vision to set up teammates. Topic’s low-end outcome probably looks similar to a Josh Giddey-type player. Even without a reliable jump shot I find it hard for a player as smart as Topic to not find some role in the NBA."

    "title": "2024 NBA Draft Prospect Profile: Tidjane Salaun",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The 2024 NBA Draft is one of mystery and uncertainty. Throughout this draft cycle, evaluators have gone back and forth on almost every single player. While one outlet has a player ranked in the top 5 another might not even have them in the lottery. One of these players who seemed to have a gigantic draft range is now solidifying himself as THE upside swing/project player of the 2024 draft for many NBA teams. This player is French wing Tidjane Salaun.\nSalaun is a 6’9-6’10 wing who has tantalizing upside. His mixture of youth and physical tools has teams buzzing and the rumor mill swirling. Recently it has been said that NBA teams are a lot higher on Salaun than the media, usually implying late lottery as his floor on draft night. This was surprising to me.\nIn my previous evaluations, I viewed Salaun as more of a high upside swing in the mid to late 20s than a lottery pick. While he showed some great flashes there was a lot to be desired with Salaun. These recent rumors made me want to rewatch his film and see if I was missing something. After rewatching Salaun I was left with a lot of questions and a lot of intrigue.\nSince this is my first player profile I want to give a little preface on what to expect. I’ll start by going over what I believe to be a prospect’s strengths or the reasons to draft them. After their strengths, I’ll cover their areas of improvement. Finally, I’ll give my high-end NBA role and low-end NBA role for the prospect. I think this helps provide some context for all the possible outcomes for a player. Now, let’s get into one of the most polarizing names of the 2024 NBA draft.\nThe first thing that stood out when watching Salaun was his physical stature. At the spry age of 18 Salaun already looks like one of the biggest players on the court in a professional league. We always see players get an inch or two added to their listed height, but if I had to guess Salaun is closer to 6’10 than 6’8. It’s not only Salaun’s height, but all his athletic tools jump out to me. His mix of height, length, strength, and vertical pop all make him athletically ready for the NBA.\nSince Salaun is, in my opinion, a very raw prospect, there are not a lot of skills that can be pointed to as strengths currently. A lot of Salaun’s evaluation is projection and that is scary for a prospect. One of the things that makes me believe in Salaun’s ability to improve is his work ethic. Outside of his size, his motor is what stood out most. Salaun ran the floor in transition, was active on the offensive glass, and made some plays in passing lanes/as a rotation defender. While he still lacks consistency in those areas Salaun’s willingness to play hard gives me hope in his long-term development.\nNow we start to get into some of the more concerning things about Salaun. I do want to mention that Salaun is one of those “late-bloomers” in terms of draft prospects. Salaun only started playing basketball in recent years compared to some who have played their entire lives. This inexperience is one of the main causes of Salaun’s deficiencies.\nThe area of most importance for Salaun’s NBA future is his jump shot. Most evaluators coin Salaun as a 3-and-D wing meaning that his 3-point shooting is a necessity. Currently, Salaun’s outlook as a shooter is pretty murky. This year he has shot just below 33% on 140 total attempts. While those numbers are pretty underwhelming there are reasons for this. First Salaun just is not consistent yet. I believe in his mechanics, has a high release point, and usually sets his feet well. Second, he doesn’t make shooting easy on himself. Salaun showed that he had tons of confidence in his jumper having a quick trigger in halfcourt and transition. When Salaun was open it did not matter if he was towing the line or a couple of steps behind it, the shot was going up. There were also a few times when Salaun was spotting up where he caught a kick out but did not know what he wanted to do before catching the ball. This resulted in bad misses, sloppy drives, and turnovers.\nAll of these factors make projecting Salaun as a shooter very difficult. I lean to think that he will eventually become a league-average spot-up shooter since I believe in his mechanics. I don’t think I can project him as a movement shooter or pull-up shooter because his mechanics were very inconsistent on the move and poor ballhandling.\nContinuing with Salaun’s scoring he has yet to show any type of midrange game and minimal stuff as a finisher. Once again I’ll bring up Salaun’s touch or lack thereof. While Salaun has some touch on his jumper and as a finisher, I would call them flashes more than skills. This paired with a shaky handle and low feel makes it hard for me to see him improving at creating pull-up opportunities or consistently getting to the rim. Luckily for Salaun his size, length, and athleticism can make up for some of the issues.\nThe final part of Salaun’s offensive game to analyze is his passing and playmaking. I’ll keep this short, it’s pretty bad. This area of Salaun’s game is the one most impacted by this inexperience. On the year Salaun had 34 assists to 50 turnovers, not great. On film, it looked to be more about lack of feel than being a bad/unwilling passer. With Salaun it just looked like the game moved a tick too fast at times. Either he would take too long to make decisions or pre-determine them. Usually, I believe that feel is something that cannot be taught, but Salaun is slightly different because of his inexperience. As he accumulates more minutes on the court and learns under NBA coaches he could develop a better understanding of the nuances of basketball.\nOn defense, Salaun is once again a work in progress. Like most other parts of his game, the physical tools and motor give him the perfect starting point to become a great defender. Being 6’9 with long arms should allow him to be disruptive off-ball in passing lanes or contesting help side. A mixture of vertical pop and strength also gives Salaun the potential to eventually guard bigs.\nIn its current state Salaun’s defense would likely keep him off an NBA court in any game that matters. Similar to his playmaking, Salaun’s defense is affected by his lack of natural basketball feel. I don’t know if there was a single-shot fake that he did not jump at this season. That paired with messy closeouts and bad footwork led to a good amount of blowbyes. As Salaun gets older hopefully he stops jumping at so many pump fakes and cleans up the other aspects he could become a solid defender.\nAfter reevaluating Tidjane Salaun’s film I was left with a lot of the same takeaways, but also some newfound intrigue. He still has a long way to go as a player before making an impact, but there are not many upside swings I would take in Salaun’s range over him. While he only moved from a late first-early second on my board to the 22-25 range I can see why a team would take him sooner.\nIn this age of the NBA big, athletic wings that shoot and play defense are some of the most valuable players in the league. Salaun is one of the best bets to become that in this mysterious draft class so do not be surprised if an NBA team gambles on his upside come draft night. If Salaun can capitalize on his physical tools I could see him playing a role similar to Michael Porter Jr of the Denver Nuggets. If he can’t develop I could see him having a fairly short NBA career."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This year in the NBA we were treated to one of the most competitive Western Conferences ever. By the time all the postseason teams (playoff and play-in) were set every team in the West had at least 46 wins. Even the eleven-seed Houston Rockets finished 41-41 which would’ve been good enough for the nine-seed in the East.\nIn a conference this competitive it can be hard to tell which teams are the cream of the crop. Every day these great teams clashed creating some great basketball, but it made it hard to discern who truly was the best team in the West.\nFor most NBA watchers, the choice was the Denver Nuggets. Looking to win back-to-back championships behind the wizardry of Nikola Jokic they played great this year but showed some regression cracking the door for other teams. Two teams, in particular, decided to break it down with a battering ram.\nBoth the Oklahoma City Thunder and Minnesota Timberwolves made tremendous leaps in terms of team success this year. Minnesota turned last year’s 42-win first-round exit into 56 wins and the 3rd seed. OKC made an even larger jump going from a sub .500 record(40-42) to the No.1 seed in the entire conference.\nEven though OKC and Minnesota had phenomenal regular seasons many still believe that Denver is still the favorite. To get a better look at how well teams performed over the season we can look at the standings seeding over the entire season.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(hoopR)\nlibrary(ggbump)\n\nrecordbyweek &lt;- read.csv(\"nba_standings_by_week.csv\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_bump(data=recordbyweek, aes(x=Week, y=Rank, color=Team)) +\n  geom_point(data=recordbyweek, aes(x=Week, y=Rank, color=Team), size=2) +\n  geom_text(data = recordbyweek |&gt; filter(Week == max(Week)), aes(x = Week + .5, y=Rank, label = Team), size = 3, hjust = 0) +\n  scale_color_manual(values=c(\"blue\", \"#FFC627\", \"lightgrey\", \"lightgrey\", \"black\", \"purple\", \"lightgrey\", \"#78BE20\", \"red\", \"#007AC1\", \"orange\", \"lightgrey\", \"lightgrey\", \"lightgrey\", \"lightgrey\", \"lightgrey\")) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25), limits = c(1, 33.45)) +\n  scale_y_reverse(breaks=c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15)) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Week\",\n    y=\"Standings Rank\",\n    title=\"Western Confernece playoff teams standings \\nplacement throughtout the season\",\n    subtitle = \"OKC, Denver, and Minnesota were consistently atop the west all year.\",\n    caption = \"Source: https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2024_standings_by_date_western_conference.html | By:Dillon Siders\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n    panel.grid.major = element_blank()\n  ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeading into the playoffs the standings finished with the Thunder 1st, the Nuggets 2nd, and the Timberwolves 3rd, but it was a lot closer than that. OKC and Denver finished with the same record of 57-25 and Minnesota was one game behind at 56-26.\nThis was somewhat unfortunate for the Timberwolves since they held the top seed for the most amount of time during the season before slipping up down the stretch. OKC followed suit by staying in 2nd most of the year before stealing 1st. Denver, on the other hand, was less consistent than both.\nFor most of the season, Denver hovered between 3rd and 4th. Even though they were less consistent than the Timberwolves and Thunder they managed to keep teams like the Mavericks and Clippers from holding a top 3 seed for more than a week or two at a time. The consistency throughout 82 games shows how dominant these teams were compared to the rest of the West.\nAnother way to show how OKC, Denver, and Minnesota dominated the Western Conference this year is their season point differential. A teams total point differential can give insight into whether they outclassed their competition consistently, or if they scraped by with hard-fought wins.\n\n\nCode\nnbabox2024 &lt;- load_nba_team_box(2024)\n\nnewnbabox2024 &lt;- nbabox2024 |&gt; \n  mutate(pointdiff=team_score-opponent_team_score) |&gt; \n  arrange(game_date) |&gt; \n  group_by(team_display_name) |&gt; \n  mutate(cumpointdiff=cumsum(pointdiff)) \n\nplayoffteams &lt;- c(\"Oklahoma City Thunder\", \"Denver Nuggets\", \"Minnesota Timberwolves\", \"LA Clippers\", \"Dallas Mavericks\", \"Phoenix Suns\", \"Los Angeles Lakers\", \"New Orleans Pelicans\", \"Boston Celtics\", \"New York Knicks\", \"Milwaukee Bucks\", \"Cleveland Cavaliers\", \"Orlando Magic\", \"Indiana Pacers\", \"Philadelphia 76ers\", \"Miami Heat\")\n\nplayoffs &lt;- newnbabox2024 |&gt; \n  filter(team_display_name %in% playoffteams) \n\nbos &lt;- playoffs |&gt; filter(team_display_name == \"Boston Celtics\")\nokc &lt;- playoffs |&gt; filter(team_display_name == \"Oklahoma City Thunder\")\nmin &lt;- playoffs |&gt; filter(team_display_name == \"Minnesota Timberwolves\")\nden &lt;- playoffs |&gt; filter(team_display_name == \"Denver Nuggets\")\nlac &lt;- playoffs |&gt; filter(team_display_name == \"LA Clippers\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_step(data=playoffs, aes(x=game_date, y=cumpointdiff, group=team_display_name), color=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_step(data=bos, aes(x=game_date, y=cumpointdiff, group=team_display_name), color=\"#007A33\") +\n  geom_step(data=okc, aes(x=game_date, y=cumpointdiff, group=team_display_name), color=\"#007AC1\") +\n  geom_step(data=min, aes(x=game_date, y=cumpointdiff, group=team_display_name), color=\"#78BE20\") +\n  geom_step(data=den, aes(x=game_date, y=cumpointdiff, group=team_display_name), color=\"#FFC627\") +\n  geom_step(data=lac, aes(x=game_date, y=cumpointdiff, group=team_display_name), color=\"black\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=as.Date(\"2024-02-15\"), y=630, label=\"Celtics\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=as.Date(\"2024-03-21\"), y=572, label=\"Thunder\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=as.Date(\"2024-03-13\"), y=393, label=\"Timberwolves\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=as.Date(\"2024-04-23\"), y=400, label=\"Nuggets\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=as.Date(\"2024-04-20\"), y=310, label=\"Clippers\") +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Date\",\n    y=\"Cumulative Point Differential\",\n    title=\"Youth shines in the Western Conference\",\n    subtitle=\"The Thunder stand atop the West in point differential despite being the second youngest team in the league.\",\n    caption=\"Source: hoopR | By: Dillon Siders\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cumulative point differential once again shows that the Thunder, Timberwolves, and Nuggets were the top 3 teams in the West.

Even though the Nuggets were below the Thunder and Timberwolves they were well ahead of the 4th-seeded Clippers by a couple hundred points.\nWhile point differential is great to measure a team’s consistency it is not the only way to predict playoff success. There are a multitude of metrics one can look at, but two that paint a fairly good picture are a team’s offensive and defensive ratings.\n\n\nCode\nnbateamadvanced &lt;- read_csv(\"nba_advanced_team.csv\") \n\nnbateamadvancedrenamed &lt;- nbateamadvanced |&gt;\n  rename(\n    Rank=...1,\n    Team=...2,\n    Age=...3,\n    Wins=...4,\n    Loses=...5,\n    ExpectedWins=...6,\n    ExpectedLoses=...7,\n    MarginOfVictory=...8,\n    StrengthOfSchedule=...9,\n    SimpleRating=...10,\n    ORating=...11,\n    DRating=...12,\n    NetRating=...13,\n    Pace=...14,\n    FreethrowRate=...15,\n    `3PTRate`=...16,\n    TrueShootingPct=...17,\n    EffectiveFGPct= `Offense Four Factors...19`,\n    TurnoverPct= `Offense Four Factors...20`,\n    OffensiveReboundPct= `Offense Four Factors...21`,\n    FreethrowsPerFGA= `Offense Four Factors...22`,\n    OpponentEffectiveFGPct= `Defense Four Factors...24`,\n    OpponentTurnoverPct= `Defense Four Factors...25`,\n    DefensiveReboundPct= `Defense Four Factors...26`,\n    OpponentFreethrowsPerFGA= `Defense Four Factors...27`,\n    Arena=...29,\n    Attendance=...30,\n    AvgAttendance=...31\n  ) |&gt;\n  filter(Rank != \"Rk\") |&gt;\n  mutate(Team=gsub(\"\\\\*\", \"\", Team)) |&gt; \n  mutate_at(vars(-Team, -Arena), as.numeric) \n\navg_ratings &lt;- nbateamadvancedrenamed |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    AvgORating= mean(ORating),\n    AvgDRating= mean(DRating)\n  )\n\nokc &lt;- nbateamadvancedrenamed |&gt; filter(Team == \"Oklahoma City Thunder\")\nden &lt;- nbateamadvancedrenamed |&gt; filter(Team == \"Denver Nuggets\")\nmin &lt;- nbateamadvancedrenamed |&gt; filter(Team == \"Minnesota Timberwolves\")\nlac &lt;- nbateamadvancedrenamed |&gt; filter(Team == \"Los Angeles Clippers\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data=nbateamadvancedrenamed, aes(x=ORating, y=DRating), color=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_point(data=den, aes(x=ORating, y=DRating), color=\"#FFC627\") +\n  geom_point(data=min, aes(x=ORating, y=DRating), color=\"#78BE20\") +\n  geom_point(data=okc, aes(x=ORating, y=DRating), size= 3, color=\"#007AC1\") +\n  geom_point(data=lac, aes(x=ORating, y=DRating), color=\"black\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 115.2567) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 115.2833) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=119.35, y=113.25, label=\"Nuggets\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=119.5, y=111.75, label=\"Thunder\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=119.7, y=115.6, label=\"Clippers\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=117, y=109, label=\"Timberwolves\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=121, y=110, label=\"Good Offense, Good Defense\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=110, y=116, label=\"Bad Offense, Bad Defense\") +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Offensive Efficiency\",\n    y=\"Defensive Efficiency\",\n    title=\"True title contenders are great on both ends\",\n    subtitle=\"While OKC, Denver, and Minnesota all plat both ways, OKC brings the most balance.\",\n    caption=\"Source: https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2024.html | By: Dillon Siders \"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 19, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen comparing offensive and defensive ratings between teams we see OKC, Denver, and Minnesota separate themselves again. Although they separated themselves the Timberwolves did it differently than the Thunder and Nuggets.\nThis year Minnesota had the best defense in the NBA by a fairly large margin. Their defensive identity pairs perfectly with rising superstar Anthony Edwards’ electric offensive game creating the perfect storm. OKC and Denver took slightly different approaches.\nNeither OKC nor Denver can match Minnesota’s defense because they do not have the personnel to do it. Minnesota starts two 7-footers, a 6’10 wing, and brings another big off the bench as their 6th man. OKC and Denver do not possess the same size, but that doesn’t make them much worse at defense.\nWhere OKC and Denver lack on defense they make up for it in offense. While all three teams finished in the top 8 in defensive rating, only OKC and Denver did that for offensive rating, both finishing top 5. Minnesota ended the season ranked 16th on offense.\nThis is again because of team personnel. Minnesota heavily relies on one player to generate most of their offense, that being Anthony Edwards. OKC and Denver can play a more balanced way because they each have multiple great shot-creators and rely more on ball/player movement.\nIn a Western Conference as competitive as this it is hard to predict what will and won’t happen. Those predictions get even harder come playoff time when everything is turned up a level. This is why saying a team like the Thunder can’t compete even though they stack up well against the defending champions and the rest of the conference can be shortsighted."

    "title": "Point Guard or Two-Way Wing? 2024 NBA Prospect Profile: Stephon Castle",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Going into this college basketball season UConn was looking to become the eighth team to consecutive national championships. Behind the returning core of Donovan Clingan, Tristan Newton, and Alex Kararban UConn just needed to fill out its roster around them. Dan Hurley went to work getting sharpshooter Cam Spencer to transfer, but he also convinced one of the best players in the 2023 recruiting class to take a backseat to focus on competing for a championship\nThis recruit was Stephon Castle. In high school, Castle was used to having the ball in his hands as a true point guard. At UConn, this was the opposite. Due to Hurley’s system revolving around player movement and quick decisions, there really isn’t a need for a true point guard. Castle adapted to this change phenomenally becoming one of the most impactful players in college this year.\nNow with the season over and Castle focused on his future there has been lots of discourse on what his future NBA role is. One sect consisting of Castle believers feels he can blossom into a point guard with time, while the evaluators less in on him believe the wing role is best. Before I get into what I think his role will be let’s take a deeper look at Castle’s game as a whole.\nScoring/Shooting\nCastle’s scoring is a major topic of debate. As a scorer, his game is fairly simplistic at the moment. His greatest strength scoring wise is his ability to finish at the rim. Even though Castle was a freshman he did not look the part physically. Castle was great at using his strength to get to the front of the rim before using his soft touch to finish. I also like his footwork and patience as a driver. When he got into a crowded paint Castle used pivots, spins, and euros to finish around defenders.\nOther areas I see Castle making a major impact on offense are in transition and off-ball as a cutter. Both of these allow Castle to show his natural athleticism and IQ. He can be a grab-and-go threat thanks to his guard skills, or he can run the wings and wait for someone to find him up the floor. Off the ball, Castle can still be a threat by making smart relocations and cuts to get himself easy looks.\nThe main reason why some evaluators have questions about Castle’s scoring at the next level is his shooting. At UConn he was very inconsistent from 3 and in the mid-range. Having a respectable jump shot will be key for Castle’s role whether he’s a point guard or wing. While I doubt he ever becomes a high-volume or high-efficiency 3-point shooter I think he does enough in other areas to make up for it.\nPassing/Playmaking\nCastle’s passing is one of the main reasons why people believe he can be a traditional point guard. For UConn, he had 99 assists to 51 turnovers giving him a nearly 2:1 assist-to-turnover ratio. While this does not mean everything it does match up with the film. I personally believe that Castle is one of the higher-IQ players in this class and his playmaking is a major reason for that.\nThe thing about Castle’s passing that stood out most to me was how quickly he made decisions. It seemed like he already knew where he was going to pass before he even caught it. His quick decision-making perfectly complements his downhill driving and cutting. When Castle can draw a help defender he easily finds the open man whether it be a spot-up shooter or a big man under the basket. This makes Castle the perfect connective passer to keep offenses flowing.\nI also think Castle’s court vision is very impressive. Most of the traits he showed as a scorer like IQ and patience transfer to his passing. This is best shown in transition where Castle is always willing and ready to advance the ball. If Castle can’t find a teammate running the floor he will look to push the pace himself trying to put pressure on the defense. He can then leverage this pressure to find the open man.\nMy intrigue with Castle as a playmaker comes with some of the advanced flashes he’s shown. He had some fun pick-and-roll passing reps with Donovan Clingan, including their go-to empty-side pick-and-roll with the screen set in the mid-range. He also showcased some fun one-handed and live dribble passes that could raise his ceiling as a passer if done more consistently.\nDefense\nFrom day one in the NBA Stephon Castle will be a good defender. He was UConn’s primary on-ball defender this year which many did not expect coming in. Like I mentioned before Castle was more of an offensive-focused guard in high school so many did not expect the level of defensive play he showcased. Playing next to so many talented players allowed Castle to put a greater focus on the defensive side of the ball this year.\nAll year long team’s top ball handlers who faced UConn were hounded and harassed by Castle. The combination of strength, length, and lateral movement makes it tough for offensive players to go around, through, or over him. This natural athleticism is paired with great technique. Castle consistently gets low in his stance and slides his feet with defenders. The final piece of a potentially elite on-ball defender is screen navigation which Castle certainly has. All year he consistently slithered around on ball screens and kept ball handlers from getting past him.\nCastle did not force a ton of steals, but I think that is the byproduct of the type of defender he is. Castle barely took any risks instead focusing on applying suffocating pressure and keeping players in front of him. Personally, I’d rather have a Castle type defender than one that is less consistent but generates more turnovers. While he doesn’t force turnovers by jumping passing lanes Castle can use his strength to stonewall drivers and make them lose the ball.\nIs Castle a Point Guard?\nDeciding whether Castle is a traditional point guard or not is mostly based on your definition of what a point guard is. For me, a traditional point guard is someone who handles a bulk of the ball-handling reps and has the responsibility to keep the offense running smoothly while setting up teammates. While Castle doesn’t meet my definition of a traditional point guard we have seen that archetype becoming less common.\nLet’s look at the NBA finals this year. Do the Mavericks or Celtics have a traditional point guard? While Luka Doncic could qualify he still shares on-ball reps and playmaking responsibilities with Kyrie Irving. What about Boston? Jrue Holiday and Derrick White wouldn’t meet the requirements I stated above either. As the NBA continues to evolve I think we will see a continued focus on sharing ball handling and playmaking duties between multiple players.\nWith all the skills Castle has shown I would be disappointed if he didn’t at least get a chance to play with the ball in his hands. The level of IQ, dribbling, and playmaking he has are all good enough to be a point guard even if it’s as a complementary piece. Also if you take him to play point and it ends up that he can’t be a point guard you can just make him a two-way connective wing. Having the fallback path of being a wing gives me a major boost of confidence in selecting Castle with an early pick."

    "text": "Much has been made about the talent pool in the 2024 NBA Draft. Most of the discourse comes from the so-called “lack” of talent at the top of the class. While I can agree that this draft lacks a certified superstar in the making that does not mean that the class is completely devoid of talent. Even without a future superstar, this class looks to be stuffed with players who can grow into high-end role players that any championship team would want.\nFinding role players that fit around your team’s star players has become more and more important for putting a winning product on the court. Offenses and defenses are becoming more advanced which makes the schematic fit between players a larger priority for organizations, especially ones in the position to compete for championships. With uncertainty surrounding some of the younger, higher-potential players it might be beneficial for teams to take an older more NBA-ready who can fill a specific role immediately. This risk of potential versus consistency has long been a topic of debate among draft evaluators.\nAge has long been associated with a prospect’s upside. It makes some sense as a younger player with the same level of talent as a slightly older one has more time to improve and surpass them. This type of thinking caused players like Jalen Williams, Desmond Bane, and Jalen Brunson to slip down the boards and return major value. While those players have some outlier development we have seen many college players with three-plus years of experience become valuable contributors to great teams.\nThis is where the term false ceiling comes in. False ceiling, a term I first heard from the draft evaluators at No Ceilings, is when a player is assumed to have a capped level they are close to hitting when in reality they have plenty of ways to improve and take their games to a level not many expected. In the 2024 Draft, I believe that Dalton Knecht, Devin Carter, and Tristan da Silva could be the next players to meet this criteria. Depending on the situation these players land in they could reach heights many do not see for them.\nDalton Knecht\nAfter transferring from Northern Colorado to Tennessee Dalton Knecht quickly became one of the best players in college basketball. This year Knecht did almost everything for the Vols on offense. His greatest strength has always been his outside shot and the shooting versatility that comes with it. Knecht was best when used as an off-ball spot-up and movement shooter. Tennessee ran him off of tons of screens and dribble handoffs from all over the court.\nKnecht isn’t just a shooter as he possesses true 3-level scoring ability being able to finish at the rim and make mid-range jumpers. He was great at curling off screens for mid-range jumpers or to get all the way to the rim. Knecht also displayed a good enough handle to pressure the rim. Once he got there Knecht’s vertical pop and strength allowed him to finish above or through defenders.\nKnecht’s false ceiling comes from my belief in his untapped potential as a pull-up scorer and his physical tools. Since Knecht was forced to handle most of the offensive load for Tennessee he was able to showcase some intriguing flashes as a creator. He won’t be asked to handle that level of offensive responsibility at the start of his career. The pull-up jumper is still inconsistent, but he flashed incredible range and shot-making from all areas and with time could become a deadly pull-up jump shooter.\nThe other part contributing to Knecht’s false ceiling is his natural athleticism. Not many prospects have the combination of shooting and athleticism that Knecht does. He’s an above-average vertical athlete and posted some great agility/speed numbers at the combine. These same movement skills and vertical pop were noticeable in Knecht’s transition play and when he attacked the rim. With a little refinement, he could become a dangerous downhill driver who leverages his shooting prowess to pressure the rim.\nHis natural athleticism also gives me hope for an increased defensive impact in the NBA. Knecht chose to transfer to Tennessee so that he could improve on his defense and that is just what he did this year. Although he wasn’t a lockdown defender I have faith that he will continue to progress on that end. Speed, strength, agility, and effort are all positive indicators that Knecht can eventually become a good defender.\nDevin Carter\nNo prospect left me with fewer questions than Devin Carter. The Providence guard had a massive breakout this year resulting in his draft stock skyrocketing. While I love every aspect of Carter’s game, the defensive side of the ball is where he has made his biggest impact. Even though Carter stands at an uninspiring 6’3 he has a similar level of tenacity and physicality that other guards like Marcus Smart have hung their hats on. He is a hounding point-of-attack defender who has the physical tools and technique to lockdown opposing ball handlers.\nOne of the main reasons Carter saw his draft stock soar was his increased offensive production. After Bryce Hopkins went down with an unfortunate injury Carter saw his on-ball responsibilities increase. He took this change of role in stride and thrived. He showed a good feel as a pick-and-roll ball handler being able to score or distribute to others. As a driver, he used strength and crafty footwork to get looks at the rim where he finished 65% of his shots.\nWhere Carter made the biggest strides as an offensive player was as a shooter. In Carter’s freshman and sophomore seasons, he only shot 29% from 3 on 174 total attempts. In his junior year alone he shot 37% from 3 on 223 attempts. These mixed results have left scouts divided on Carter’s projection as a shooter. I am a believer in his shot because of the amount of attempts this year and the difficulty of those attempts. This year he showed tons of confidence as an outside shooter taking 11.2 3’s per 100 possessions. This amount of volume paired with the range of some of his shots and the self-creation/pull-up flashes makes me confident in Carter’s shooting.\nCarter’s false ceiling lies in his potential to eventually be a lead guard and his athleticism. There isn’t a single area where Carter isn’t a plus athlete. He broke the combine record for ¾ court sprint at 2.87 seconds and tied for the highest vertical at 42 inches. Carter also showcased his elite agility and lateral movement skills. His athleticism is clear on the film whether he’s pushing the pace on a fastbreak, catching a lob dunk, or sliding his feet and chesting up defenders.\nThe other part of Carter’s game that makes me believe he is a false-ceiling prospect is his potential to be a lead guard. Some evaluators have strictly classified Carter as a shooting guard, but I think that puts a cap on who he could become. Carter did not post any astonishing assist to turnover numbers, but I think he shows the patience and vision to grow into a lead guard. He probably won’t be asked to be that early on, but with time Carter could provide a similar impact as a Jrue Holiday or Derrick White.\nTristan da Silva\nThe final player that I believe has untapped and unnoticed upside is Colorado’s Tristan da Silva. This year for Colorado da Silva did a little bit of everything. He was their second-leading scorer and similarly to Knecht showcased scoring from all 3 levels. While he doesn’t have the same shooting prowess or range as Knecht he is currently better in the intermediate ranges. What impressed me most was his touch around the rim and in the mid-range. He shot 61% at the rim which is alright, but he shot 49% on non rim 2’s. He was great at pulling up in the mid-range or using his size and touch on push shots in the 7-12 feet range.\nEven though da Silva isn’t the same shooter as Knecht, doesn’t mean he’s not a good floor spacer. I do not think he has the same movement versatility, but da Silva still shot 39% on 162 3-point attempts. This all-around scoring makes da Silva a threat from anywhere on the court and defenses know that. This allows him to use his above-average handle for a 6’9 player and connective passing to get others involved. Lots of teams are looking for dribble-pass-shoot wings, especially ones with above-average height like da Silva.\nThe main reasons I see untapped upside in da Silva are offensive versatility, ball handling, and touch all packed into his 6’9 frame. Like I said earlier every team is looking for large wings with the offensive skill da Silva possesses. His overall versatility should get him on the court right away since he can seamlessly fit into multiple roles. Once da Silva enters the rotation his scoring versatility, handle, and connective passing could let him develop into one of the most coveted young wings in the NBA."
